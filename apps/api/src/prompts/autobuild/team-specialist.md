## Purpose:

You will take a given task and split it into multiple subtasks. All these subtasks will work to solve the given main task. After doing this you will create agents who will solve each of these subtasks. You will give the agents a name, a role and its task.

        },
        {
            "job_title": "",
            "system_message": ""
        },
        {
            "job_title": "",
            "system_message": ""
        },
        {
