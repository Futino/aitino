The Art of High Level Sales,"So you've been looking at improving some sales skills or getting into sales as a career. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this obviously. While sales comes naturally to some, there is a collection of small details you can take from each to improve your game. Some are naturally great a building rapport, some just speak with confidence, or some just have that natural aura that people feel comfortable around them. Those secrets will be exactly what this series covers. Starting with understanding how high level sales is an art form that can be replicated.   
  
  
  
  
  
One of the saddest mistakes a large majority of business owners and sales managers make is not training their sales people. Not having the right tools to perform the job leads to mediocre performance and high turnover rate. Sales is stressful enough, then add figuring it all out on your own. Most sales reps just mimic what they saw before and hope that works. You need to educated yourself. You'll hear me say this a lot throughout this series.   
  
  
  
Everything Is Hard Until You Understand It.   
  
  
  
Jiujitsu is an extremely technical sport. The better your technique the better you perform. Black belts take about 10 years to get on average. Just a decade of repetition and improving your skill set. Michael Phelps swam 8 hours a day for years without missing a day. Just improving technique and skills.  Imagine if you put that kind of effort into improving your sales technique and skills.   
  
  
  
While sales is hard to feel comfortable in at first. This playbook will give you the foundation early on to start succeeding and near the end, if you are following everything, you should be exceeding all your other reps. I'm going to teach you rapport building like I learned when I was a Human Intelligence Collector in the army. For those of you that don't know, that's the guy that does interrogations and convinces people to spy on their friends for our interest.  
  
  
  
We will be going over how to approach, where to look, posture, your tone, active listening, building a network and so much more. Everything I've learned over the last 14 years of doing every type of sales and always coming out on top.   
  
  
  
That's it for now. Pt. 2 will be Understanding the Sales Process. I'm going to cover an ideal sales process and how approaching it as a step by step system will significantly reduce the stress and give you confidence to close more consistently.

If you are in sales or interested in getting into sales, feel free to send me any questions you might have. I have no problem helping give some advice. I don't charge you for anything unless we're doing real coaching. If you have any request for information to be added to the playbook, just let me know. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I want this to be a tool you can use over and over for your entire career. Thank for you time. See you on the next one.

1bj7m89,,,,,,,,1710918831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1bj7m89/is_it_really_possible_to_get_rich_from_nothing_or/,Is it really possible to get rich from nothing or should I stay REALISTIC??,"So, I’m a 20M. I’m in my second year of medical school in my country. I‘m the oldest and only boy in a family of 7. My family falls in the category of lower middle class with lots of financial constraints.   


My parents are getting old and tired from the low quality of food and life and the tons of efforts they exert to keep this family alive, and I’m really grateful for that.

My question is that can I really get rich if I educate myself and work for it??? Or is it just a pink dream??

I’m asking this question because medicine doesn’t pay the bills in my country. Doctors work in the hospitals for minimum wage. 140 usd a month for a family of 4 is impossible. Not to mention how badly they’re treated and how long they work. 

It’s just not worth it.

&#x200B;

I‘d rather be own boss and work on my own thing.   
I’ve started to learn copywriting and this opened up my eyes. I know that it’s going to super hard. 

I find that I have to study an insane amount of things. Even more than what I study in med school. 

Writing emails, sales pages, funnels, etc. Prospecting, and outreach. Sales, and marketing. Studying my market and my niche and knowing how to give a high quality service. 

It‘s way harder than medicine because it’s all on me. 

My goal is to gain enough experience as a freelancer in these things and then start turning it into a business like an agency for example, and get into the world of business from there.

I’m practically starting form nothing. All I have is my phone and tablet. 

Is this goal worth it?? Will business relieve my financial constraints and help me provide the best life possible for my family?? Or is it just a pink dream the online gurus sell to young men like me???

&#x200B;

If it’s the right thing to do, I’ll be more than thankful for any tips or advice.

The gist is you can add activities for members of a community or customers to complete to earn points towards a reward and compete in a leaderboard. For me keeping my community/customers engaged was always a challenge and we did gamification albeit manually and with a lot of headache. So we thought to ourselves maybe why not build the tools to do this? Any perspective on this area?

We decided on $5000 on pre-revenue and he paid me $2500 without any long and deep due diligence but then he disappeared for 15 days, and there was no contact, I tried to reach him numerous times during these 15 days but no response. Then he replied and asked me to work for him even during the acquisition.   


we decided on the cost and started work for him with one of my colleagues. I paid my colleague a good advance amount and did ask my client to pay me but he said he would pay soon because he didn't do any due diligence and pay me without any delay in the start. I trusted him and we started working. 

&#x200B;

The work was way way more than what was decided. And I didn't charge for most of the small gigs as a goodwill gesture. And then came a makeover of this product. So I again asked for the remaining $2500 which was the acquisition cost and then the remaining cost up till that date of work. Which was around $1200. So total pending up till now was $3700.   


Then he said he needed to show a demo to one of his clients. At that point, I got to know that he was upselling the product but it was not my concern. I needed the money which was due at the first place. Then he ghosted me again for 8 days and suddenly he paid the remaining $2500 of the original acquisition cost then the Christmas holidays came and he just disappeared again for 22 days. 

&#x200B;

And then when he approached me, his tone was different. We worked so much on the makeover that the designs kept on coming, nothing was decided, and there were no boundaries set to the project I was afraid to ask anything because I wanted to get paid, I was not working on anything else, its going to be my bread and butter for the past 2 months and next 2 months. One night there was a bug in the app and he threatened me that he would stop working with me if I didn't make things right within one night so I keep working all night.  


I was disturbed and nervous but then I decided to ask for my payments. He said that he already paid, I told him that was the acquisition cost and then he said okay, transfer the ownership to him and he will pay, I transferred the ownership of the GitHub repo and he ghosted me for 26 days. I kept asking about the progress etc but he didn't reply then one night the app was down and he came back to me. I told him to pay then I would work on it, he said just turn on the app and he would pay right away.   


And the same thing happened again, that SOB ghosted me again. Now he said there were some negligible bugs, and he knows that I can solve those but according to him he pays only when the app was bug free. I even told him to pay in installments but he said no, he will not pay anything. And then he texted to part ways because it is not working.   


But today I am launching that app again and decided never to sell it again and increase the MRR to 10K.

I believed these people got lots of visitors and definitely customers who pay. Stories I heard a long time ago made me think this was true.

**We launched on Product Hunt on 1st of September.**

The month before, we worked hard to get ready. We did hackathons to make our product better and prepared a lot.

We worked all day and night, got lots of votes, lots of visitors, and hoped a lot.

**And**  
**We won.**

We were mentioned in Product Hunt's newsletters,  
Got a lot of backlinks,  
And many people talked about us on social media.  
We spent thousands on AI,  
And hundreds of hours making improvements we thought were important

...

But, as time went by, no visitors turned into customers. Even worse, we couldn't get any feedback from users. At the same time The Product Hunt community is overkind, so we didn't get real feedback there as well We didn't know what to do next.

**Our hope from winning on Product Hunt wasn't real.**  
In fact we didn't get any customers who pay from that launch.

We got into a classical trap: People like to make things simple. We want success fast and try to find shortcuts. But there's no easy way, and it's hard to deal with these feelings.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Every product takes a long time to succeed, and founders change things many times to find the right path.

We did too.  
Two months after launching, we added the payment wall.  
We started getting customers, having today over 100 paying customers  
And we're still making changes.  
We still are not happy with the progress.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell):

> In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.
 
After a few years of helping developers review code, I came up with 10 code smells and how to fix them while building my project [Axolo](https://axolo.co).

### 🧐 Refactoring Large or Complex Methods

Navigating through methods that sprawl across numerous lines or twist into complexity can be daunting. Simplification is key!

The fix? Employ a linter to enforce a maximum number of lines. Deconstruct these behemoths into smaller, more focused methods, each dedicated to a singular task.

### 🤔 Addressing Long Parameter Lists

A lot of parameters can muddle method signatures, making them prone to mistakes.

The fix? Consolidate related parameters into a single object. Adopt the ""parameter object"" pattern to streamline your functions, enhancing their readability and maintainability.

### 🙄 Minimizing Excessive Comments

An overload of comments often signals that the code isn't speaking for itself as clearly as it should.

The fix? Strive for code that explains itself through judicious naming and structure. Reduce reliance on comments, allowing the code's purpose and function to be immediately apparent.

### 🤦 Eliminating Duplicate Code

Repetitive code fragments are not just a nuisance; they complicate updates and can introduce inconsistencies.

The fix? Seek out and consolidate repetitive code segments into common functions. Adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle simplifies future maintenance and modifications.

### 😕 Harmonizing Inconsistent Naming Conventions

Naming chaos confounds understanding and introduces potential errors.

The fix? Commit to a unified naming convention. Names that are clear and consistent pave the way for code that's more approachable and decipherable.

### 😬 Enhancing Error Handling

Neglecting comprehensive error management can lead to erratic behavior and a codebase that's tough to sustain.

The fix? Embrace thorough error management. Logically log and manage exceptions to bolster the code's stability and dependability.

### 🤯 Simplifying Overused If/Else Constructs

An abundance of if/else branches can tangle code, making it challenging to read and adjust.

The fix? Lean on data structures or design patterns, such as polymorphism, to untangle complex logic, thereby enhancing the code's legibility and adaptability.

### 👎 Refining Inheritance Usage

Inappropriate reliance on inheritance can entangle code further, reducing its adaptability.

The fix? Verify that inheritance is used judiciously. Opt for composition over inheritance to achieve a code structure that's more flexible and straightforward to maintain. 

Be honest, which one do you usually see in your PR? If you think I'm missing something, let me know in the comments!",False,0.0128499999999999,The post is focused on software engineering best practices rather than seeking development services.

\- Now talking to as many customers as possible to learn from their feedback

\- I already spent way too much time on features that are rarely used. Extremely hard to find the balance between quality and overengineering.

\- Marketing is overrated, if the product is good people will come. 

\- Multiple currency support is super important, received a lot of feedback about this.

The idea being I will fully take over their business in the next year as the original owner retires. There is to be no cost/financial gain per se to the owner, as I will be taking over their liabilities and covering them (insurance wise) for the next 12 years. That is the deal. I will however have to cover costs during the handover such as purchase of equipment, legal costs and the transition month where they pull their money out of the business and I’ll be liable for the overheads during the month of transition where costs are coming in, but I won’t yet have had a full month of work to invoice yet (if that makes sense).

Prior to takeover I’ll be joining the business as an equity director to get upto speed with their projects and get to know their clients for a period of ~6 months. I’ll be bringing in work during this time (currently equal to 25% of their current income). My question is how do we decide the share allocation during this period?

They have proposed two solutions:

1. When I join I get a % of shares based on the work I’m bringing in. My concern with this is there is then no flex for if I bring in more work.

2. They charge my existing company as if I were a client for the work their staff do on my jobs. My concern with that is that takes all the profit out of my work. I’m effectively giving them that work for “free”.

I’m sure there are other options. I just feel like neither are the right fit yet, but I can’t think of what would work best. They are good people and we are all working in good faith towards this goal. Would really appreciate suggestions, thank you all.

The concept has already been proven to work as there are a few businesses doing well at this. I just think they could be done better, smoother and with cleaner UIs.

I recently stopped working for a SaaS startup who was doing something similar but more complex and for a more specific industry. So I'm taking what I learned from there and using it to build my own platform.

Using a no-code platform might not work based on my research (please prove me wrong). I've done some Javasctipt coding before and believe that using React to build this platform will be the best way to do it (The startup I left also used React to build theirs)

With my very limited coding experience, I plan on building this platform focusing on the core features first before releasing it.

Without giving too much away, the main feature is based around a kanban board style of management.

I don't know all the available resources that could be used to build something like this and would appreciate any advice or information please.

*Background:* I have an [older version of PhotoSwipe working on my site](https://photo.2re.net/) but I am learning Vue and the old version uses jQuery and jQuery conflicts with Vue.

All I want to do at this point is to use the code on the [Getting Started](https://photoswipe.com/getting-started/) page to work so I can figure it out from there.

It says you need the Core, Ligthbox, and the CSS.

I linked the css in the head like it says so I don't think that's the issue. My guess is that I'm putting the JavaScript in the wrong place but I'm not sure.

I've tried putting the JS code in a script tag before the HTML code, after it, making a separate JS file and linking to it in the head, linking to `photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js` and `photoswipe/photoswipe.esm.js` in the head, but nothing seems to work. I thought maybe the there was some kind of configuration on my computer not allowing me to execute JavaScript locally or something, so I uploaded my different versions to a web server and it still didn't work.

`import PhotoSwipeLightbox from '/photoswipe/photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js';`

After my last launch on Product Hunt didn't get featured, I spent quite a bit of time reflecting and asking myself why it didn't make the cut. It was a bit disheartening, to be honest. However, Product Hunt recently shed some light on this very topic, sharing key reasons why products might not get the spotlight we hope for.

Here's a quick list they shared that I'm keeping for next time:

* It's gotta be a SaaS product, not something like a PDF.
* Don't forget to add a maker comment for engagement.
* Check your links; broken ones are a big no.
* Schedule your launch ahead of time.
* No repeats; make sure your launch is fresh.
* Big updates only, no minor tweaks.
* Be clear in your tagline about what your product does.

Given the limited screen size of mobile devices, it's essential to keep the interface uncluttered by minimizing the number of buttons, popups, and links.

Enter the sticky action button.

This engaging feature offers an easy way for website owners to increase conversions from mobile visitors.

**Benefits of using Sticky Action Buttons**

**1. Offers better engagement:** Sticky buttons are like sticky notes on your fridge that remind you to do something. Whether the user scrolls up or down the page, the sticky button is there to remind them to take a particular action.

**2. Higher quality conversions:** Studies have shown that in the last 15 years, the average attention span has dropped from 12 to 8 seconds. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that visitors who scroll through your website or spend more time than average on it are demonstrating a certain level of interest in what you have to offer.

Automate your sticky action button to appear when the visitor has either scrolled a certain percentage of the screen or spent an amount of time on the page. Presenting your call-to-action at the moment where the visitor has shown some certain level of commitment can improve conversions.

**3. Draw visitor's attention with animations:** We’re naturally drawn to movement, so an animated sticky action button is bound to draw a visitor's attention. The animation should be subtle, in a way to nudge the visitor to click the button, but not in an intrusive way that it becomes irritating.  This is one you’d have to test to find out what works best for your brand.

**Don’t take my word for it, here are examples of popular brands using Sticky action buttons as part of their conversion toolkit.**

1. Basecamp - $374.8M/yr
2. Riverside Fm - $30.3M/yr
3. Mfino - $1.42M/mo
4. Just Call - $1.6M/mo

## The product

ColdClicks is an AI based cold email personalization tool so naturally it made sense to use the tool to market itself.  The way it works is, you upload your leads, the tool researches each lead then uses AI to write the first line of your email.

This makes each email you send hyper-personalized, and relevant to the recipient, which significantly improves your reply rates. It also saves so much time compared to doing it manually.

We've been bullish on the idea of cold email being an incredible growth channel for bootstrapped startups for a while - it's very low cost yet highly scalable, so we decided to put our idea to the test.

## How we did it

First we identified our target market. There's a lot of ways we could've gone with this, but we started with lead generation agencies as these are the guys sending the most email, and an increasing reply rate will directly increase their bottom line.

We built a small, lead list targeting small lead gen agency owners based in the US. The contents of the email were very brief:

>Hey {{firstName}},  
>  
>{{personalization}}  
>  
>Reaching out because I noticed you're doing a lot of lead generation.  
>  
>We've built an AI tool that generates highly-personalized emails at scale to improve your reply rate.  
>  
>Would you be open to learning a bit more about this?

Of course, we used ColdClicks to personalize each lead based on their company website! Overall we got over a 21% reply rate, 6 trial sign-ups, and 1 paid conversion.

## Goals

As the internet is pushing against spray & pray models of outreach, with more platforms putting restrictions on high volume campaigns, it's important to make each email count. Personalized openers help significantly with this, they're the best way to grab the prospect's attention, and let them know the email is relevant to them and to keep reading.

**REPEAT AFTER ME - In third world countries (India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil etc) workers DO NOT get paid by the hour.**

  
So why this culture of hourly wage for software developers online?

  
Before we answer this question, let's look at some things.  


* **Most freelancers are from Asia, South America and Eastern Europe where the salaries and cost of living is super low.**
* Most of the world sees Americans as rich, spoiled and completely unaware of what is going on in the world. And this is somewhat true.
* Hourly rate on Upwork and other freelance sites is highly inflated. To US buyers $20/hr may seem like a good deal but you are actually getting ripped-off. $20/hr is MORE than what Americans get paid for the same work in many parts of our own country.  

* Let me give you an example -  
$20 x 40 hours = $800.00 per week  
$3200.00 per month (post tax), this is salary for developers in many small towns of America, even today!
* So why are you paying foreigners who is low-skilled and has cost of living less than one-tenth of Americans?  
You are hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who doesn't really care about your work, works whenever he feels like & charges you 3x-4x  more than what Google pays their engineers in India. FACT!

**WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE**

* Most workers on these freelance websites like Upwork, Freelancer etc are not good designers or developers. They are the leftovers, the people who were not good enough to be hired by local companies or international tech companies.
* Then there are these ""agencies"" run by code-pimps - a non-technical businessman, calling himself project manager. This guy hires non-english speaking developers for salaries that are even lower than local rates, exploiting them. There are many of them on Upwork, most from India, Pakistan, South America and Ukraine.  

* **MY SALARY AND COL DATA IS ACCURATE**
* I spoke to various reputed recruiters and companies who hire developers in India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China and Ukraine.
* DO NOT trust the salary sites on the internet. Most salary data on these sites is crowdsourced and guess what happens when you crowdsource? Numbers get highly inflated by the coders themselves.  
**The problem is as Americans, everything we do is in English, open and available on the internet. But we know nothing about foreign lands. Especially third & forth world countries. Their local sites are in languages that we do not understand, so we are totally clueless to what actual wages are.**  
*The foreigners on sites like Upwork know our local salaries. But how do you find costs and salaries of the world?*
* Do you know the cost of decent lunch in Beijing? What about a nice rental apartment in Surat India or 10 mile taxi ride in Kiev or Caracas? You do not. And that's where you lose!
* Idiots will say I am talking like a privileged American. That I am not. I am a foreigner myself, who loves to travel, pay people well for what they are worth, so they live well WHERE THEY LIVE, based on their local wages.
* This post may get a lot of flack on a far-left website like Reddit. But everything in this post is factual.
* ***Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to boost their own company earnings. But guess who gets shafted, YOU, the buyer.*** The American small business owner. The entrepreneur.  
You will get screwed by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine or any of the South American countries. Period.
* I have compiled list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. There will be many naysayers and folks who will say my numbers are wrong, but **THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE REAL MONTHLY SALARIES OF AVERAGE PROGRAMMERS** in these countries. 
* Some may even throw words like ""slavery"" and ""racism"" , ""taking advantage of poor people"" ""being cheap"" etc etc. Those statements are invalid and does not negate facts.
* **Running a business is about being frugal and smart, being aware of what's going around you.**
* Cost of living in these countries is super low. Anyone disputing my factual data has an underlying devious motive.  
So here is the ACTUAL Developer salaries and COL data from various major cities around the world which took me months to collect, analyze and verify.

* **As Americans, it is hard for us to even imagine any salary below $10 per hour. But that is the case for most of the world outside of North America & Western Europe.** 
* The salaries for places I listed are NOT low, they afford perfectly decent living conditions locally.  

* So next time you hire a programmer, coder, developer for your project from Upwork or any third-world country through any platform, remember these people think you are foolish & that you are completely unaware of local wages. 

&#x200B;

* So how much will you pay for your next project, you American idiot? :)

I would like to get some insights or advices  on acquiring customers. The title says promotional marketing items industry, but it is a little broader, which later I will explain.


My mother is planning on opening her own business, where the main strength is her connections and ability to decrease the costs of projects by 30-40% when compared to local market.

She has approximately 15 years of experience of working with promotional marketing projects and things around, mainly for FMCG industry (think in terms shampoo stands in market where only products from Nivea are present, branded items for companies like hoodies, hats, powerbanks, brochures delivery and distribution to clients via mail in big quantities, etc.). The role of her company is mainly to be a supplier/middleman of things and services mentioned above. Currently for example she is managing inventory for online store of one of the clients, where she find the suppliers, introduce new items, etc.

Her clients were companies like Hyundai, Procter&Gamble, Heineken, and many similar in size, projects were sometimes on country level or global level.


But in all of the cases, the clients were coming to their company by themselves, or were acquired by different department, so my mom didn't had insights into that.



Now when it comes to starting the business, the something what I would like to hear some opinions about is marketing strategies.

First of all, she has Non-compete clause for 6 months (if she quits), which forbid her to reach out to current clients of her company, but that's fine, because the sizes of projects and required budget for payments are too big for starting. 
She would like to start from the beginning, to get traction, and when the finances will go well, focus on it fully.


First ideas how to start to get some traction and projects is:
*Public tenders (basing on historic data, she sees that she could easily outbid competitors)
*Reaching out by cold calling/emailing to local companies like hers in the industry asking for becoming sub supplier for some of the projects
*Targeted advertisement on LinkedIn towards profiles from sectors where the most clients are coming from in her current company


As the beginning, I think she should create the website with some study cases as examples, where visitors could see possibilities of cost savings thanks to her work.

If it useful, she is operating mainly for regions like BeNeLux/Europe. (As some stragies may be completely different for asia, etc)",False,0.01193,"The post discusses strategies for a promotional marketing items business, not a software startup."

For a bit of context, I am a propulsion engineer and have a comprehensive knowledge of jet engines, how they’re put together, and how they operate. 

What started as a passion project of designing (in CAD) my own jet engine has morphed into a business idea of producing and selling it as a DIY STEM kit. The plan is for it to come in a kit (miniature toolbox that I make via laser cutter), complete with colored instructions and education insights into theory of operation, how gearboxes work, the purpose of an adjustable exhaust nozzle, etc. 

My engine will be fully motorized with adjustable controls (w a digital RPM readout), interactive with removable parts, audio/visual effects, and a simulated afterburner (made with a fog machine, LED, and fan). It will be 3D printed but also uses real hardware, servos, magnets, electronics, etc. 

I am roughly halfway done designing/testing it and am hoping to complete it by this fall. I have no doubt that there is a community that would be interested in this, but I wanted some business advice, thoughts on how viable of an idea this is, and how I can shape this into a legitimate company. My jet engine is designed to be scalable and I have other ideas for jet engine models (turboprop engines, concept futuristic type engines, etc ). Also,  I plan on selling this online but I am open to other options and opportunities related to its STEM content.

However, seeing as they were sold to Squarespace, I recently found myself in need of a replacement. I did a bit of looking around and figured that I would share what I learned in case it's helpful to anyone else.

**Best domain registrars**

There were a few registrars that kept showing up more often than any others. They usually had glowing reviews, and few to no complaints. Here they are in approximate order of how commonly they were recommended:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)
- [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

One catch with Cloudflare is that you are locked into using their DNS.

**Dishonorable mention**

Most people recommended avoiding GoDaddy due to poor customer service and scummy business practices such as price hikes and buying up domains that people search for.

**Final thoughts**

Instead of looking on a registrar, you can use [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en) to check domain availability.

Also sharing a tip that helped me in my last startup raise more than $3M.","To avoid possible post deletions, I'll share the list though the google form below.  
About the tip I've used to raise from VCs, it's pretty straigthforward but no one does it:

1. Visit the investor website.
2. Go through their portfolio companies.
3. Find founders that are in a similar industry as your company, or founders that you think would find your startup interesting.
4. Connect with founders through email or LinkedIn asking about their VC.
5. Ask for a 15min. video call, share your story and offer help.
6. If the chemistry is good, kindly ask for a warm intro to the investor.

Really, this is the way I found the lead investor for my biggest round! The amazing thing about this is that sometimes even the founder gets involved with you to see the best way to generate FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) with the investor. Yes, you'll get some mean ""No's"" along the way from stuck-up founders, but if you don't have a track record of a $100M exit, or your parents weren't VC's classmates in Standford, this is the best way to build a strong network.

Also, for the investor, having two different data sources saying you're speaking with many funds and founders helps a lot pushing them forward.

  
A last thing, I'm also building an AI tool to help with this entire process: 1) finding the best matches inside an even bigger database than the excel I'm sharing based on thesis, portfolio companies, and many data points, 2) Giving full contact information of all team members of the fund and their portfolio founders. If someone is interested too, please let me know!

To start this journey, I drew inspiration from various solopreneurs on Twitter, X, and through reading posts in this subreddit and Indiehackers blog.

## Inspiration

Throughout this journey, I encountered remarkable solopreneurs such as:

1. [Marc Louvin](https://twitter.com/marc_louvion) **(marketing, fast shipping, SEO)**
2. [John Rush](https://twitter.com/johnrushx) **(marketing, SEO, SaaS apps)**
3. [Dan Kulkov](https://twitter.com/DanKulkov) **(marketing)**
4. [Nico Jeannen](https://twitter.com/nico_jeannen) **(Facebook ads)**
5. [Philipp Keller](https://twitter.com/philkellr) **(SEO)**

Who were helpful enough to share their journey in public. Reading tweets from them started leaving impressions of ideas in my mind and thereby shaping my thinking to build apps in a better form. 

## Observation

Inspired by these solopreneurs, I learned and implemented their strategies. I realized they were part of a bigger picture – ideas for creating a profitable SaaS product. So, I decided to create a comprehensive guide called the **""Successful Solopreneur Guide""** to help others succeed in creating one.

## Organizing

I began bookmarking tweets, blog posts, and Reddit entries related to SaaS development and organizing them into sections like marketing, SEO, and branding.

## Solopreneur guide content structure 

The guide has three sections:

1. Marketing (20 to 30% complete)
2. SEO (basics covered + 1 approach to increase DA + 2 successful profiles)
3. Branding (10% completed)

Now I will mention what all is covered in each sections

2. [**SEO**](https://cookiewriter.com/successful-solopreneur/seo)
   1. Introduction to SEO, how is SEO done in the real world, and free tools to help in your SEO journey.
   2. SEO fundamental basics like what is DA, what is on-page SEO, and three important elements of on page SEO
   3. Running SEO on autopilot and how Wilson Wilson did it for Senja.io and grew its DA from 1 to 68 in a year
   4. Successful profiles
      1. John Rush's 7 Low Hanging SEO Fixes for busy Founders (Part 2)

   1. Twitter/X growth strategy

The guide is a collection of important SaaS-related Twitter/X links with additional information added wherever necessary.

The aim of the [Successful Solopreneur guide](https://cookiewriter.com/successful-solopreneur) as mentioned earlier is to help as many people as possible with building a profitable SaaS with the experiences from successful solopreneurs all organised in one place.

USE the tools out there,"I’ve launched 3 SaaS websites in the past year and if there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you should never try to implement something that you could use a tool for instead

I’ve started with Brideabi where I did everything myself ([read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/s/wJslLWYNN0))
, continued with [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) where I did a pretty decent job and finally [Vojo](https://vojo.app) where I absolutely nailed it!

The problem

As an engineer, it’s easy to fall in the trap of the desire to implement everything by yourself, especially if you haven’t built something yet (for example an invoicing module) or to be afraid of so many 3rd party dependencies.. and as an engineer, you would be right, but not as a startup founder!

You see, the problem is that implementing all these features takes a lot of time and they will certainly have issues that will increase the required time. When you are building a new SaaS, it’s important to get your product in front of your users as fast as possible to get feedback the soonest

And the worst part is, next time you will need something similar, you will very likely have a completely different tech stack and you won’t even be able to reuse your old code.

I agree that reducing the number of third party dependencies is important, but only after you have your PMF and you know it’s worth investing in the product in such a way

Some examples of what I did right and wrong.

1. In case of Brideabi I did everything myself. I’ve already talked about it on the link above so I’m not going to go into more details here

2. For [TLPrinting](https://tlprinting.net) I’ve done a lot better job. 
- For backend, I’ve used firebase. It also manages authentication so I’ve hit two birds with one bullet.
- For subscription management, I’m  completely relaying on Stripe, no need to store my users in my database when I can ask Stripe for the info.. well, for technical reasons, there would be, but again, in the first phase, it’s completely fine
- What I did do that good, is that I’ve build a messaging form with completely custom code.. and it has some major issues and limitations

3. In case of [Vojo](https://vojo.app) I’ve managed to raise this to an even higher level

- I’ve used Supabase as backend which from the perspective of this post is very similar to firebase but offers even more possibilities to have code in the backend (for free)
- For customer support I’ve used Brevo, it’s super easy to integrate and offers not only email marketing tools but also pop-up chat
- And of course stripe will be the source of truth for memberships but it’s not integrated yet

Conclusion

When launching a product, you need to forget about your engineering side and look for shortcuts. But don’t forget to always keep the door open for change if anything goes wrong!

After a year of me running it on the side while having a full time job, it was clear the best way forward was to sell for a variety of reasons. We decided hiring a new manager and scraping off the top wasn't logistically feasible. 

We spent \~6 months trying to find a private buyer but ultimately now have the business listed with a broker. There are several low but encouraging offers within the first week so it's looking like it will sell soon-ish. The deal being presented to potential buyers is a one-year leaseback to give us time to wind down operations, although a buyer could of course make an offer to take over sooner.

We currently have \~3-4 full time employees and 5-part time. They are all aware of the situation and the most critical employees are willing to stick it out since most of them have been with the company for \~30 years and are nearing retirement. We are of course hoping to give a generous severance (\~2 years) if at all possible. The family member who passed had little in retirement, so we have to be sure his spouse has plenty for retirement. 

Are there any words of wisdom or cautionary tales as we approach closer to selling? We have an accountant that will help, but should we look to hiring a business lawyer and/or financial advisor? Due to the death, there is a very important opportunity for the step-up in basis which we want to be sure is fully utilized to our advantage.

**Here's a shocker: In third world countries like India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil, etc., workers don't get paid by the hour. So why the heck is there this culture of hourly wages for software developers online?**  


Before I dive into that, let's set the scene. Most freelancers are from places where the cost of living is dirt cheap compared to the U.S. And guess how ***Americans are seen? Rich, spoiled, and totally clueless about the world around them. Ouch, but kinda true.***

  
Now, brace yourself: The hourly rates on platforms like Upwork are massively inflated. Sure, $20/hr might seem like a steal to you, but in reality, you're getting ripped off. That $20/hr? That's more than what many Americans earn for the same gig in small towns across our own country.  
Let's do some math: $20 x 40 hours = $800 a week. That's $3200 a month after taxes – which is what developers in many small American towns make, even today!

  
So, why on earth are you shelling out big bucks to foreigners who are less skilled and live in places where the cost of living is a fraction of what it is in the U.S.? You're basically hiring a subpar ""freelance"" developer who couldn't care less about your project, works whenever they feel like it, and charges you 3x-4x more than what Google pays their engineers in India. Yep, that's a fact!  


Now, let's talk about what's really going down here. Most of the workers on platforms like Upwork and Freelancer? They're not exactly top-notch designers or developers. They're the rejects, the ones who couldn't land a job with local or international tech companies.  


And then there are these so-called ""agencies"" run by code-pimps – non-technical businessmen posing as project managers. They hire non-English speaking developers for peanuts, exploiting them to no end. You'll find heaps of them on Upwork, mostly from places like India, Pakistan, South America, and Ukraine.  


Oh, and in case you're wondering, my salary and cost of living data are spot on. I've spoken to tons of reputable recruiters and companies across India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, China, and Ukraine.  


Don't bother with those salary sites on the internet – most of that data is crowdsourced, and you know what happens then? The numbers get pumped up by these offshore coders themselves.  


**Here's the thing: As Americans, everything we do is in English and out there on the internet for all to see. But when it comes to foreign lands, we're clueless. Their local sites are in languages we don't understand, so we're totally in the dark about actual wages.**  


Critics might say I'm talking like a privileged American, but that's far from the truth. I'm a foreigner myself who loves to travel and believes in paying people what they're worth, so they can live well – based on their local wages.  


This post might ruffle some feathers on a far-left website like Reddit, but every word of it is fact. Freelancer sites like Upwork have created a culture of inflated hourly rates to line their own pockets. But who gets screwed over? You – the American small business owner, the entrepreneur.  


You'll be taken for a ride by workers in India, Pakistan, China, Ukraine, or any South American country. Period.  


**I've painstakingly compiled a list of ACTUAL developer salaries from various countries. Sure, there'll be naysayers and folks who claim my numbers are off, but guess what? They're ABSOLUTELY 100% ACCURATE.**  


Some might throw around words like ""slavery,"" ""racism,"" ""taking advantage of poor people,"" or ""being cheap."" But those words mean diddly squat when faced with the facts.  


Running a business is all about being smart and frugal, and being aware of what's happening around you. And let me tell you, the cost of living in these countries is dirt cheap. Anyone arguing with my data has some ulterior motive.  


So, without further ado, here are the ACTUAL developer salaries and cost of living data from various major cities around the world. It took me months to gather, analyze, and verify this info. And just a heads up: most foreigners looking for work on these platforms fall into the Junior category.

So, next time you're scouting a programmer, coder, or developer for your project, whether it's on Upwork or some other platform from a third-world country, just remember – these folks think you're clueless about local wages.

I have good business acumen, you put me in any industry, I can build a profitable business. 

I'm a tech guy (CS engineering), Marketing guy (4 years ran my marketing agency), Sales guy (since 16 i've been selling), Finance guy (I have a great grip over capital markets). 

Now after trying a lot of things, I've got a great idea (I'll share whoever is interested) that I really think that can blitzscale crazily ($0 to $540M in revenue with $108M profits in 3 years). I have bootstrapped all my previous ventures, but now I feel like raising capital will give me a great edge and leverage. I cannot bootstrap because building a financial infrastructure requires capital upfront ($650k as angel round). 

Its been 2 years I've been trying to raise capital from VC's but got 70+ rejections, Micro VC firms but got 30+ rejections, then angel syndicate but got 20+ Rejections, my last route is super angels. 

If this doesn't work I seriously don't know wtd. I cannot take failures in life, I believe in Win big or go home. 2 Years of rejections hasn't even slightly made me feel depressed, but making no progress has. 

Upon that my GF broke up with me 3 months back, we were supposed to get married this year, but things fell apart. 

I the only reason I wanna win quick and big is so that I can retire my parents and give them their life back, they've sacrificed their 20's, 30's and 40's for my sake. 

I'm at the most lonely stages of my life, no friends, no GF (she was my emotional back bone, she was my go to person for everything), I cannot share with my parents, because I dont wanna stress them. 

I have a list of 50 big angels who're worth somewhere in between $500M to $1bn. 

If they reject, Killing myself is an option. I'm seriously done with so called life, I dont remember when was the last time, I felt happy, or smiled, or even laughed. My life is in shambles.

My question is to the ones who have made a comeback from this situation. 

Have you gone through this situation and if yes,

It has two types of mails:

1. It has a chat, and when you don’t answer for more than X minutes it will send you an automatic mail “hey, John sent you a new message”.

2. Same thing for orders, “Your receipt for Y”.

The first one should have a button unsubscribe at the bottom, since it’s not a required mail, but an optional one. 

I’m currently using Resend for the Type1 mails, together with a node.js server which scans all the chat rooms and detect if a message hasn’t been answered for more than X minutes.

I could obviously integrate a table on my Supabase DB, check if the user has unsubscribed and then don’t send the mail.

I would like to know if a better and faster solution to manage all the mail service exists, counting that I’m using next.js and i will probably integrate marketing emails in the future too (which requires an unsubscribe button too).

Their proposed solution is to just issue ""Estimates"" instead of ""Sales Orders"". The header of an Estimate can be customized to read ""Sales Order"", seems like no big deal. WRONG.

We've made the switch form QuickBooks desktop to QuickBooks online and we are finding that Estimates can't activate many of the functions required to run our business:

* You can't print packing slips from an estimate. You have to create an estimate, then create an invoice, then print the packing slip from the invoice. Sending invoices as sales order confirmations is a problem so we just have to create estimates (labeled as sales orders), then click back into QuickBooks to create an invoice immediately after, then print a packing slip. 
* Accurate ""Bundles"" pricing is reflected in Invoices, but not Estimates (Sales Orders). In QBO you can bundle products (great!). For example, we bundle freight cost with the product it matches so when you add that product freight is automatically applied. Freight per product varies by shipping zone so shipping product A to Zone 2 costs less than shipping product A to Zone 5. We have custom price rules to adjust freight cost according to Zone (great!). The problem is, price rules aren't calculated for bundles in an Estimate (Sales Order).  If I bring in a product+ shipping bundle, the base price for freight is demonstrated. The Estimate doesn't take into account price rules for shipping Zones of bundled items. The invoice does calculate the price rule for bundled shipping, thought. This means that the price of our Estimate (sales order) does not match the price of our invoices.

I've been side hustling and starting and running my own businesses since I was 14. I want to talk about my most recent business venture and how much of a colossal failure it was.

Myself and my brother started a restaurant in the UK (2022), we used all our savings to purchase equipment, hire staff, and set up systems. A lot of heart dedication and money went into it. Despite our best efforts we failed, 8 months in we realized we wouldn't have enough money to continue and decided to cut our loses while we still could. It was devasting. All our hard work. Poof gone. 

So why am I telling you this? It's because you need to know that failure is incredibly likely as business person. No matter how hard you try, how much money you might invest, and how good your plan is the chances of success are slim and a lot of this is **pure luck.**  We had a 20% chance at best at succeeding. But we went with it any way because the rewards this lifestyle can offer are amazing glory, riches, and achievement.

I'm currently in the process of developing a prototype for a tool that I believe could revolutionize the way we create user guides online. The concept is simple yet powerful: imagine being able to create comprehensive user guides for your website or application without any coding knowledge required.  
  
Here's how it works: I'm developing a Chrome extension that allows users to select elements on their website or application interface. Once selected, users can easily add content for each step of the guide via a simple popup interface. After completing the guide, the tool generates a JavaScript code. When this code is implemented on your website or application, the user guide starts running seamlessly, providing step-by-step instructions to your users.  
  
I believe this tool could greatly streamline the process of creating user guides, making it accessible to a wider audience who may not have coding skills but still need to provide clear instructions to their users.  
  
Before I dive deeper into development, I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. Do you think it's something that could be useful? Are there any features or functionalities you'd like to see included? Any potential concerns or drawbacks that come to mind?

We’re a niche marketplace connecting suppliers and customers with SaaS tools for both sides. We have 20 suppliers, 600 customers, 800 transactions, $380k in GMV. Our take is 5%, though our revenue is a little lower at $15k because we cut some deals with the first few suppliers. Plenty of room to grow regionally and nationally. The regional TAM is around $300 million, nationally it’s a $30 billion industry.

The company is me and my co-founder and 6 contracted engineers at an agency overseas. This is our third company my co-founder and I started together (1 failed, 1 gave us middle class incomes for 10 years but no exit). 

I’m not interested in being the CEO of a unicorn. I’m not interested in VCs. I don’t want to be in the cover of magazines, I don’t want to be a keynote speaker at a conference. I like starting businesses because I’m naturally curious, industrious, and I like problem solving and selling. My goal is to keep it geographically constained for now, dig deep not wide, bootstrap everything, and focus on sales and product. My engineers are excellent and we’re all working hard and well together. 

When I look for guidance on the path forward I mostly find start-up stages like pre-seed, series A/B/C, IPO, etc. I’m not interested in that path. I’d like to keep it small, no shareholders, bring it up to a few million ARR, and sell it one day. 

Neither do I want to make this all up on my own. Surely there are some entrepreneurs who came before me who walked this path in tech.

I’m looking for some advice regarding how best to invest some cash. I’ve recently started a web  services company and have had two small, successful website projects that have left me with $5,000 cash. Great start but they are pretty much one off projects without much hope of recurring revenue.

I’ve got a day job in IT management making around $150k but would like to transition to working for myself. I’ve got a crew of folks who are willing to work with me and can fill gaps on projects in areas I’m not great in such as sys admin, cloud architecture, business analysis, and database administration.

Before moving into management (and now on the side) I did full stack web dev. As such, I’ve done everything from fully custom enterprise apps to CRM projects to Wordpress landing pages to e-commerce sites. But I’ve mostly worked for other companies, hence why I’m a little less sure of what to do in this situation. One last bit of background, I can tolerate a bit of risk as I’m not the only income/insurance provider in my household but need to keep my job until I can do so without catastrophic financial impact.

A few questions for you all: 

- Should I be optimizing my business to serve e-commerce clients? This seems to be an area where there is a lot of potential goal for recurring revenue tied to overall sales of your customers.
- Should I use my “war chest” to start advertising my services?
-  What areas should I focus on providing services that have a high revenue yield?

I have been thinking about this for a while. We are not a huge company by any means but we have some distribution. We had done some market research but I figured here people would be the most honest.

Here is my idea:

We are planning to create a Roblox like platform for gambling, everyone will be able to create their own casino games through a simple game engine without coding and decide on assets, themes, odds and everything else our internal bot will test these games to make sure they have  a positive casino edge and then publish it on our casino network we will do a 50-50 revenue split with the creator.

My main concerns are:

a) casinos might be hesitant although we have proper licensing and with a couple of audits and a separate tab for these games (probably would need to pay extra or lower commissions for that) they would probably be ok.

b) players might be hesitant, casinos are all about trust but might be able to overcome this via some marketing magic.

The advantages would be:

a) People would be extremely eager to show their ""masterpiece"" to the friends, most of these creators, would at least initially, be gamblers themselves and likely to have a network of other gamblers thus we would have an incredible amounts of free marketing from these games.

b) Infinite possibilities and huge creative freedom, studios would are only likely to product what is already popular some of these people that are gambling themselves for very long times would know what the current issues are and address them with creative and efficient solutions.

Wdyt? It is an unusual idea but one that can be quite big if implemented correctly. Also, don't worry about the technical details we have a very talented team of engineers and we are profitable from our other games so we have plenty of time to create a solid product.

I want to see what options I have to bolt on a front-end with payment/user billing. I took a look around, the closest to what I am trying to do is the OpenAI billing page. 

Basically, I have a saas (python/django-based) with all backend processing, user access working correctly. Basically a user calls api to perform some action and each call costs an amount that is then deducted from the balance they have in the account. And when the balance is zero, the api call will fail with reason being ""not enough balance"" (something like that, you get the idea). 

I do have a user table (postgres) that has user info with their corresponding tokens and I have tested with api calling tools like insomnia/curl and everything works ok. Next phase is then to bolt on the front-end part for registration and billing. 

It is also possible there are other ways to do it that could be simpler and less problematic, perhaps, test with a simpler option before going full blown. I am open to ideas.

I have ADHD and one byproduct is that I’m very one or the other when it comes to things. Either extremely confident or unfaithful, extremely motivated or unmotivated.

Pair this with a habit of analysis paralysis. I am so obsessed that my idea will be a success, once all my dopamine gets burned out, I start thinking of all the cons, all the ways things could go downhill

This is the reason I’m scared,

For one this isn’t some high skill monopolized market. Anyone can do it and get fairly good as long as they have a couple thousand to spare.

That’d being said it’s a relatively uncommon business at least outside of the agricultural industry and into the general populace.

Like Tesla, everyone outside and in the industry knows about it, mushroom growing isn’t anywhere near as mainstream. Majority of the people who know about mushroom farming are mushroom farmers lol.

I see it as an industry that could be over saturated very easily and quickly which scares me but at the same time, it’s relatively underground so I see it as an opportunity to “buy low”

Secondly, my main customer demographic would be farmers market customer’s. What happens during the winter months when it gets cold? I can grow indoors so supply isn’t a problem but my customer demographic would shrink significantly. Would need to rely on restaurants and small grocery stores.

Html/css/js/php

I created a new website using an old website I made as a template. Essentially I copied the nav bar and footer and the scss/css files. I created a new homepage layout and created 4 more pages using the layout. Everything looks great using localhost. 

The problem: 

When I uploaded the site to the cloud vm the CSS is still of the old site. I just noticed the entire CSS file is the old file. Maybe that will help solve this. 

What I’ve tried/discovered:

Browser caches cleared. Chrome and Firefox look the same. Tried on mobile and another PC. Tried editing html stylesheet path from /style/style.css by removing the leading /. I had to change it back. I have verified the style.css.map includes the proper scss files. I have verified the CSS that is loading is not the same as the CSS that is on the server. I tried moving the old site from /var/www/html to another location. 

For example. The font family and color of the old navbar is completely different from the new, yet the old font and colors load. I just noticed the whole CSS is different also because everything is the old. 


Hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I’m no expert but I’m really lost on this one. 

Edit/update: I just adjusted the vhost file to ignore the old site vhost and only look at the new url. Went to the IP on the server and the new website is there looking great! It’s only the URL that is bugging out. I have a virtual host set up. I will try not using the vhost file next. So glad the error is stating to show itself.

######So one side of my question is logistical- 
-How can couples set a business up legally to protect their personal finances, particularly the finances of a spouse that is not legally involved? Things like setting up an LLC and avoiding sole proprietorship, putting pre/post nups in place, etc.

I want us to both be able to support each other’s dreams, but be informed and prepared in case he doesn’t find success, or worse.

######The other side of my question is communication-

-How do couples with a businessowner spouse manage hard discussions about finances and difficult times, particularly during the hard initial grinding years?

-What do couples where the spouse’s business failed wish they would have done differently in terms of communicating with each other?

-How can we set expectations and boundaries, and bake in time for each other along the way?

So I’m being groomed to inherit the family business. I’m mid 30’s, married with young kids. We are a small company that’s been around 25+ years and we have 16 employees. We are consulting firm in a niched software industry so our bread and butter are billable hours.

My background is mostly sales with some leadership positions being held at other employers. Leadership such as managing small teams and was managing 32 people at one point in time. I’m not an expert on the software but I’m learning and I can sell our services well.


I’m just tired. I’ve never managed a group of people before that have made my life this difficult. I’ve spent the last 1.5 years slowly stepping into my leadership role now. Bringing in some good, but hard change, taking steps to help mom and dad enjoy retirement while trying to grow the company. 

I’ve got a handful of people on my sales and marketing team, all of which are incredibly young and it’s hard leading these people. They expect the world to be handed to them, yet have zero responsibility or own up to their mistakes. But I’m quickly thrown in the frying pan when I make a small mistake. It’s slowly destroying me because I try very hard to be a human and a decent leader. I know I’m not perfect and I make mistakes, but everything that goes wrong is my fault. Nothing is ever their fault. It’s difficult for them to take any initiative, they mostly require very direct instructions. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at my wits end.

I understand I need to stop being a people pleaser and perhaps become more stern. But I don’t want our company to be like that. I don’t want to squeeze 150% out of my people to pad my parents pockets.

I think it’s time to bring in a trainer and provide some education. But the crazy part is, my consulting team runs itself. They have little to no issues. They work hard, are grateful, and go out of their way to help not only the company but anyone else.

I don’t know how to manage my time to lead these people, try to keep this company moving down the path we want, spend time with my wife and kids, and not go crazy.

Before anyone says, “everyone has an idea for an app, keep dreaming”……

This pitch for a successful application is not something I just came up with. it’s basically an evolution of my previous business which I closed down due to my mothers untimely death. My mental state impacted my ability to function and work, I still pay the bill for the 1-800 number that I still own and I also retain the patent and renew it when needed. At one point this 1-800 number business was bringing in about $200,000 a month gross earnings. it was a nationwide, phone number and service number. 

This was all about 10 years ago. I’m currently a successful business owner in Long Island and own about 10 laundromats. I’m looking into reviving this old profession, as I can see a vision of it, being way more useful now than it was before given the technology. 

I don’t want to dilute into much of what the application would be about. I only own the patent for the phone number and the service, but I do not own the idea of it being an application at this time.  

Before I go through with getting a patent on my name with my idea, I just want to know is it hard to get an application off the ground and be successful? I’m willing to invest about $800,000-$1 million into the company. But I know I probably will not be able to do it on my own and be as successful as Uber or something like that.

I have done a lot of searching but still want to ask my specific question. I'm very new to this and will consult a professional but am trying to figure out what I need to know and my questions for them.

I am a mental health therapist in Indiana and am planning to work part-time with a company that will pay me as a 1099, as a way to establish myself, with the goal of eventually moving to a more profitable PP. (Due to health insurance, etc. I will likely never be full-time in PP, so my income will remain on the lower side.) I've seen it recommended, but not required, to establish an LLC for business income/expenses. 

Additionally, I am a self-published fiction author. I just started making any money in 2023 and received it in a 1099. My research has said I don't need an LLC for this unless I make more money and/or publish other people's work, etc. I doubt I will ever make much in this venture, but I enjoy it. 

Further, I'm also a yoga teacher. Again, 1099 payments from a couple places I've taught, in small amounts. This will also remain low-income, however I would eventually like to get an additional (expensive) certification and combine yoga with my therapy work. That's a ways off, though.

I don't want to establish 3 separate LLCs due to the work required for each compared to the small income I will make from each (therapy will be the most, but still not a full-time income). I know the purpose of the LLC is to limit personal liability should I be sued in one of these avenues. I also know that this protection doesn't cover malpractice, which is the main reason I could possibly be sued in any of these areas (and I carry separate insurance for therapy and yoga). 

So, my question: Would it be a good idea to establish a general purpose LLC using, say, my name or something generic, then use DBAs for each venture? Or is that overkill at this point? (The application for an LLC in Indiana does not require an industry code, so it seems this would be OK based on my Googling...)

I am a YouTuber with a small but dedicated following (<5000 people) in a niche sport making money but not much. I am taking this year to try and grow my channel and other revenue streams. I expect to make money. I am also building a website / forum that initially will be for my followers to interact with me, but I would like it to eventually become the “go to” website / forum for this niche sport. I am also dropshipping merchandise via the website to my followers with the website logo and general other niche sport merch. I feel confident in the business plan. But I am very unclear on legal compliance with local, state, and federal regulations and how to structure these different aspects of the business. 

YouTube and the dropshipper send me 1099s. I also expect to make money doing lessons and promotions and similar influencer stuff. I am planning on beginning as a sole proprietor because the LLC cost in California is 800 dollars a year and I don’t want to shell that out until I’m actually making substantial money. I have very few assests to worry about liability, but I don’t want huge fines or legal issues.

Here’s an example using golf of why I’m confused:

My name is John Smith. My YouTube channel is named TheGolfer. My website is called TheGolfersClubhouse dot com. I sell merch through printify.TheGolfersClubhouse dot com. 

As a sole proprietor do I need multiple DBAs and business licenses? Do I need a business license at all? Do I need a DBA at all? If my YouTube name was John Smith, it seems like I wouldn’t need a DBA, but since I am “TheGolfer” I might need a DBA? Would the website and merch business fall under my DBA for The Golfer? Or would I have to get another DBA for the website since it’s not the same exact name for my YouTube as the website?  Do I need a sellers license for the merch even though they handle sales tax?

I know businesses can have multiple branches, but it seems like a YouTube, website, and teaching lessons might not all be covered by the same DBA unless I was just using my name, John Smith, on YouTube, John Smith dot com for the website, and giving lessons as John Smith Golf Instructor. 

Am I overthinking this, and does it even matter if most of my income currently is 1099s and only really operating online (aside from the lessons which I could do as John Smith)?

Please help. There’s plenty of general information on starting small businesses but this online stuff seems like the Wild West, and I have a feeling most people are just not complying.

user visits website >> enters sign up flow on website >> completes questionnaire and signs up >> can log into the app.

I need the information displayed in the app upon login to reflect what the user has already shared during sign up. The content is updated daily i.e. a module is unlocked as they progress or is unlocked for them depending on their skill level / answers.

When we first opened we had a very very petty business owner 15 minutes away that was publicly mad. We specialize in one of the many items he sells on his menu. (Ex our restaurant is donut heaven, he is dessert mania and he sells donuts, we only sell donuts- not the actual menu item but you get the point) 

It started off with him telling customers, leave us 5 stars and them 1 star and I’ll give you 5 bucks off. It worked and we got 3-4 1 star reviews. We found this out because he offered one of our customers the offer and they came and told us. 

We had a very public dispute on social media which ended up with some customers saying we were being unprofessional, and should just let it be. Honestly they are wrong, not to be arrogant, but am I supposed to just let this guy bully me? Whatever we stop calling them out and maintained a 4.9 star rating on Google so it’s okay. 

But this guy won’t stop. And the recent batch of reviews he’s been leaving have been personal. Mentioning family by name, claiming fraud, claiming we are unsafe for families. Crazy stuff. It’s been going on for a year.

I am currently a Senior Database Engineer working on a project for an issue I have seen come up time and time again with data roles. That is understanding the schema of the database and the connections of data flows. This is often the biggest hurdle when you join a new data team and takes the longest to wrap your head around since there are years of business nuances that must be understood before truly getting a grasp of a new data model.  
  
My educational background is in mathematics and economics at a university in the United States. I have spent most of my career working with data in one way or another. Before my data journey, I worked at a consulting firm focusing on helping F500 companies fill in specific fields in their quarterly and yearly reporting.  


**About the project:**  


The goal of this project is to create a closed-source software that data teams can use individually to get those insights on a table so they can be more familiar with the database they are working with. Moreover, gain better insights into the database so they can work with more confidence when they want to make changes. Which tables are the most important? What do all of these columns actually mean? What stored procedures/dbt models are the most important to grasp? This is something that sucks both for experienced members of a data team since until they understand this data teams are not comfortable letting them have more autonomy since they lack basic knowledge and sucks for the new/inexperienced members of the team because they may feel unconfident with making changes due to their lack of knowledge. Or even worse make a change and it is incorrect because they were lacking important information. Think making a change to a stored procedure/DBT model without understanding the downstream effects of these changes due to other stored procedures that use that table.  
  
The goal of this project is to create a closed-source software that data teams can use individually to get those insights on a table so they can be more familiar with the database they are working with. Moreover, gain better insights into the database so they can work with more confidence when they want to make changes.  
  
Most software on the market today is focused on either SQL development, database monitoring/tuning, or general DBA work. This would be less focused on these aspects and more focused on the structure of the database itself, although we could incorporate ideas from these applications into this one.  
  
**Technical stack:**  
  
I am most familiar with React and Python so I have been using that for testing. This will most likely be a desktop app so I do not believe I will need any cloud technologies. On the backend side, I feel confident in getting an MVP but would love a cofounder to work through the nuances of the project. Hence the post where I am looking for someone strong in front-end development to help me with this project.  
  
**Who I am looking for:**  
  
Nothing specific. I am not looking for a wizard or anything like that. Mostly looking for someone who I can connect and work well with. I have had this problem in the past and would rather fail this project with someone I can get the next one started with than someone who is a react god but can't work well with.",True,0.01615,The post is looking for a technical co-founder which aligns with the targeted audience.

a) Are Chinese freight forwarders worth it and what's their role in all of this? Prices seem similar to direct shipping from my manufacturer, so I don’t think I fully understand how they work.  
b) Is there a way to skip shipping to me and send the orders directly to customers, maybe through a distribution center (potentially in Europe)? My main market is EU, but I also ship some orders globally.

Basically what it's designed to do is to get user out of their comfort zone, create and attend events, connect with similar thinking people and explore new places.  
  
This idea came to me a year ago and it came to me because I was the one that wanted to get out of my comfort zone, because I was cooped up in my ball, just working, going to the gym and after that just watching TV and going to sleep. It was super boring and to be honest that life itself felt super depressing.  
  
I wanted to change something, started reading loads of blogs on how to liven up my life and it actually worked, I started doing some extreme stuff, random stuff, to just not sit on the sofa all day watching TV but to actually do something fun. That's when I decided that I could try to help others like me get out of their comfort zones.  
  
So basically I started making this app, it's been almost a year since I started developing and I actually already released the app. It's been in a Google Play market for almost 2 months now and I only have 100 users so far. Not gonna lie, it sucks to not get recognized by the work I've put in for almost a year.  
  
So my question is, maybe you guys have any ideas on how to get a higher user base? Maybe you have some comments about the app?  
  
You can find the app on google play store by searching Adventure Buddy or just by clicking the link below:

But almost all startups I hear about are focused on closing funding rounds and finding investment. This sounds concerning to me for two reasons:

1. I have chronic health issues that sometimes throw me off my game for a month or two - I even lost a job because of this at one point. Because of this, I am extremely risk-averse. I always try to avoid any long-term commitments that I cannot quickly get out of, pay for things upfront, and never take on any debt (not even mortgage - what if I lose another job and can't pay?) My whole being protests against the thought that someone may entrust me with a large sum of money and I will be liable if it goes to waste.
2. I have zero experience with running a business. If I hire a lawyer or an accountant or a marketing specialist, I have no way to tell if they are legitimate (I had at least one bad experience with this in the past). I feel like I simply don't have the necessary skills to smartly manage the kind of money on the order of hundreds of thousands.

I suppose I could try simply building everything myself, not have any commitments, and use some well-known accounting agency when I need to figure out my books and taxes.

Is this a viable way of building a SaaS business? If so, why almost 100% of founders that I hear about seek investment? Is it just to speed things up when you already have experience building a business?

I do I make this more profitable? I thought about 3 options when we have enough money on the side.

1) Move out to rent a bigger place.
2) Get another place and keep this one.
3) Rent a place just for the laboratory in order to free up space in the place we already have.

Hey folks,

First: this is my first monorepo with pnpm and turbo.

I'm encountering a puzzling issue with turbo and pnpm and haven't been able to pinpoint the root cause. Here's my turbo configuration, which is fairly straightforward:

    {
      ""$schema"": ""https://turbo.build/schema.json"",
      ""globalDependencies"": [""**/.env.*local""],
      ""pipeline"": {
        ""build"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^build""],
          ""outputs"": [""build/**"", ""dist/**"", "".next/**"", ""!.next/cache/**""]
        },
        ""lint"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^lint""]
        },
        ""dev"": {
          ""cache"": false,
          ""persistent"": true
        }
      }
    }

My project structure is:

* `./apps/portal`: nextjs
* `./apps/gateway`: express+tsoa
* `./apps/api`: express+tsoa
* `./package/database`: prisma package

Upon a fresh clone of the repo, running `pnpm install` followed by `turbo build` works perfectly. However, if I run turbo build again without making any changes, the Next module is somehow removed from `node_modules\.pnpm\next@14.1.0_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0\node_modules\next`, causing the build to fail.

In order to make it build again I need:

1. kill turbo process
2. run `pnpm install --force --prefer-offline`

 I am running on Windows, with developer mode enabled to allow symlink.

* Turbo version: 1.12.5
* pnpm version: 8.15.4
* Next.js version: 14.1.0
* Node.js version: 20.9.0

I'm puzzled why the Next module is removed and why these steps are necessary to rebuild successfully. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or has insights into what might be causing this behavior? I'm looking for any configuration advice or troubleshooting steps that could help resolve this oddity.",False,0.01436,"The post is technical but focused on a specific coding issue, not on seeking a technical co-founder or development agency."

I am seeking an online credit card processor for my business via my website. The website is purely informational (medical office) but I want a way for patients to have a convenient way to pay invoices online.

Here's my ideal cc service:

* Patient visits website (eg [doctorsoffice.com/pay](https://doctorsoffice.com/pay)) and it takes them to a form to submit payment.
* The form has a few fields for informational / reference purposes (name, email, invoice number) and the amount they wish to pay
* Input cc info
* Ideally, I would love to tack-on the processing fees to the total, though this isn't a must.

I don't need the system to be able to pull-up invoices or anything. Manual input of the $ amount by the payor is fine.

Once complete, I would want the ability to download a CSV of all of the payments so that we can quickly reference them and reconcile to our invoices.

All the features seem attainable and simple enough that I have to imagine there are many services that would offer this seamlessly as a plug-in to the site.

Drop me a comment with a short explanation of what your startup does, and I will give you the name of the investor, a reasoning of why the investor can be a good fit, and the investor website.  
  
A bit of my background, I'm a startup founder that has raised several funding rounds. I know the pain in the ass that is to find through endless investor-lists enough investors to make a successful funding round, so I decided to build a tool to save time on this.  
  
For reference, here's an example of a startup description, so you know how much detail is needed:  
  
*Mercury startup example: Mercury offers banking for startups at any size or stage. With an intuitive product experience, founders can access free checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, domestic and venture debt, and more — and manage their business with confidence. Mercury also offers community programs that provide founders with the connections, advice, and resources to help them build the next great companies.*  
  
*Example match:*  
  
*Liquid 2 Ventures: Liquid 2 Ventures focuses on seed-stage investments, showing interest in financial solutions like Sequin's credit products. They can provide early-stage support and resources that are critical for a fintech business.*  
  
*Website:*  
  
*Clocktower: Clocktower Technology Ventures, with specific interests in the fintech sector including innovative platforms like Copper Banking, could offer specialized knowledge and partnership opportunities for a fintech startup.*

The other option is to use a browser wrapper - specifically Tauri 2 or Capacitor - with Svelte. However those naturally will only work with static Svelte, *not **Kit***.

Here is one thing I learnt.,"Over the past 4 years, I have been working on a web app that aims to help people diversify their reading by starting a mission to read the world. The idea is to read at least one book written by an author from each country in the world. The project started as a way for me to track my reading progress. I have been taking it slow, working on search engine optimisation (SEO), talking and listening to users, making updates and trying to build something useful. Over the years there were moments I got discouraged by the slow progress and almost gave up on the project. 

At one point, I abandoned the project and worked on other things for one year. So progress has been slow, but steady until a few days ago, out of the blue, I noticed a huge spike in the number of people visiting my site. I got more user registrations in one day than I normally get over a whole month. At first, I thought maybe Google had suddenly fallen in love with my website, but that wasn't it. To cut a long story short, it took me some time to realise that the sudden spike in traffic was the result of my site being recommended in one of the Morning Brew newsletters. I am not sure who I should thank for the mention, but I am grateful. I view this as confirmation that I am creating something that people want. Conversations with users have confirmed that.

What I am trying to say here is whatever you are working on, keep doing what you are doing and do not give up. **You will either succeed or fail and learn something**. You should be OK with both possibilities as long as you enjoy what you are doing regardless of the result.

I'm a Javascript dev with 10+ years of experience mainly working on the front end of websites and web apps but am looking to extend into full-stack territory by learning NodeJS.

To that end, as a learning experience I am building a web app from scratch using NodeJS, React, PostgreSQL and Prisma.  
I have my database designed, I have the models built in Prisma, I have my API's documented in insomnia. I have a basic Node app with a number of GET routes for accessing data in the database seeded by Prisma.  
So far so good.

What I'm working on next is authentication and this is where things start to get tricky.

What I have so far is a registration form that creates a user in the DB, and a login page that allows a user to log in and access the system.  
When a user logs in a JWT is created and an HTTP only cookie is created, when a user then attempts to access a route in my node app the cookie is sent with the request and the JWT is verified.  
When a user logs out the cookies is destroyed.

What I want to add next is a refresh token to go along side the access token and for a new refresh token to be issues whenever a new access token is created (so token rotation).  
What I can't seem to figure out is how to check a JWT to see if it is expired, obviously when you verify a JWT it will tell you it's expired but it seems tricky to actually be able to do anything with that information as at that point an error is generated.

So far all this is implemented without any 3rd party auth packages as I want to make sure I fully understand it and for me the best way to do that is to build it myself.

Any help and or pointers would be grateful.

Looking back, what were the biggest pros and cons? 

I am relocating this summer for reasons unrelated to my own career. However, I’m looking for new career opportunities now because it’s unlikely that my current employer will allow me to work fully-remote. I’m considering all my options, but I think I want a change of pace. I’ve had a pretty diversified career journey so far - I’ve worked in hospitality, served in the military, and have been working in corporate finance for the past five years. Both times that I switched careers, I found that the skills and experiences I gained in my previous career(s) were highly valuable and allowed me to be successful very early on in my new career.

Working in corporate has been great. I learned a ton, led and developed effective teams, and made significant contributions. A major downside of working in such a big company is that my day-to-day is burdened with a lot of what I consider to be non-value added work: multiple layers of reviews before making decisions, resolving issues between affiliates, and just so much unecessary process. I’m wondering if I’d find more fulfillment working in a small business, presumably having much more breadth of responsibility but at a much smaller scale, and being able to make decisions much faster. I think I’d likely be taking a pretty big reduction in compensation, but hoping that the benefits outweigh this.

I did not want the business and asked for a buyout but the partner refused and made me stay in a situation I didn’t want to be in. I got backed into a corner until I caved and bought it. 

Although the business is doing fine the mental gymnastics I have to do every day to feel ok going to work are leaving me feeling suicidal. Everyone kept telling me that if I didn’t buy the business the landlord would sue me for breaking the lease.

I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped and sad every single day. I’m glad to see my staff enjoying it - they are happy and making money but I am slowly drowning in my own thoughts. Yesterday, I stood by the subway and genuinely considered jumping in front of the train.

I have been making a version of this file for about 2 years, for new clients at my agency. Its kind of something I do to pass the time while waiting for access to their ad accounts.  


Now after making a few for redditors in exchange for testimonials (an arrangement I'm still open to), I have systematized my process, and turned it into a template and instruction manual.  


I have it gated elsewhere. I'm actually charging for it on my gumroad store, just to see if the template alone has that type of value.  


My goal is to offer these as a service for maybe a few hundred bucks, and eventually, work with my developer friend to automate the process, lower the price, and scale up the volume.  


For now, I'd love feedback on the template, and I'd love questions about what I do with these when I make them for my clients.  


The early feedback is that the value of this service could go way up with the addition of a ""reccomendations"" section. I see that as a possibility.   


I am also curious to hear what someone who follows my manual thinks of that as a product. I'm very interested in empowering businesses that are just starting and have low budgets. I know from when I was at a startup, we would have done the work ourselves to save the money.

This job pays $2000 a week base plus $150 a day per diem, for overnight stays since they cover 12 states. So I started a llc to do this legally for tax purposes. Initially I opened a sofi account to keep my business money separate from my personal money but that turned into a nightmare. Sofi froze my account after the first deposit was made and has had it locked up since. So I have $4700 frozen in Sofi for the past 6 weeks. They froze it because the deposit had my name and the llc name on it and sofi doesn't do business accounts. I then opened a Lili business account and have been using that since. The reason why I wanted to use sofi was because I wanted the 4.6 apy to generate more money and for the physical checking for purchases. Lili doesn't offer either of these, no apy and no actual checks. Seeing as most of my interactions are with Amish, and they don't do wire transfers or accept debit, I really need access to physical checks in order to pay them. So I need some help trying to figure out how to set my Lili account to direct deposit into another account that has physical checks. I know I can just transfer the money to another bank but in order to get the perks of most banks then you need to have direct deposits made.

Apprentice-level Piano technician here, looking for some general advice from anyone who’s been in a similar place. There’s pro’s and con’s to running your own business versus working for someone, and I’d be interested if someone could weigh in on my predicament.

I’ve been working at a medium sized piano rebuilding shop for 6 years, and have accumulated lots of great skills like tuning, action rebuilding/regulating etc. 
In the past year I’ve been developing a side hustle with servicing piano’s in homes and schools, and it’s going great so far!
My day job at the shop is starting to feel like a lotus island. There are just enough things keeping me there– healthcare is provided, and I can just show up and work without doing any front-end/back-end business stuff. 
I’m making more per hour with my side hustle than at the shop, and I’m feeling frustrated with what’s available to me pay-wise at my day job. Love my job, and don’t mean to be shallow but I really just would like to be making way more money than I am now. 
I also have a feeling that a lot of tech’s would love to have the job that I have. It seems less intense than being a traveling tech. 
I have a feeling if I leave this position at the shop I work at, it won’t be available again in the future. Although I’m 27 without kids or a mortgage and I don’t want to settle if I don’t have to!

In such a short time, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with two amazing content creators. By making myself known and putting in the hours researching and writing, I managed to amass a solid following. This following was significant enough to catch the attention of micro to medium-sized content creators. It took everything I had just to write that cold DM, especially considering they were much bigger than me. However, I still reached out, and eventually, I secured the cross-promotion.  
  
I don't expect you to follow my advice, but if you want to take it into consideration, feel free to:  
  
1. **Target micro influencers:** In the beginning, focus on connecting with micro influencers. Don't be scared to reach out to them; they are just as eager to grow their audience as you are.  
  
2. **Be honest about your following:** Never lie about your following. If you don't feel comfortable sharing that information, try to avoid the question, but always maintain honesty in your interactions.  
  
3. **Value is key:** Keep value as the main conversation topic when reaching out to collaborate. Explain how both content creators and their audiences can benefit from the collaboration. Highlight the mutual value exchange to encourage partnerships.  
  
4. **Don't be intimidated by subscriber count**: It's okay if the influencers you reach out to have a much larger following than you. Remember, the quality of subscribers also counts. For example, the first influencer I worked with had close to 70k followers on Instagram, while I had only hundreds. However, we managed to send each other almost the same amount of followers. Focus on the engagement and relevance of your audience rather than sheer numbers.  
  
5. **Build genuine relationships:** When reaching out to potential collaborators, focus on building genuine relationships rather than just seeking transactions. Invest time in getting to know the content creators and their work. Building trust and rapport can lead to more meaningful and long-lasting partnerships. I still talk with Alex from time to time.  
  
6. **Research audience compatibility:** Make sure your audiences are compatible!!! Ensuring compatibility between your audiences can lead to more successful collaborations and increased engagement with your content.

1bkgxrm,,,,,,,,1711053880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bkgxrm/really_frustrating_issue_with_welcome/,"Really frustrating issue with welcome emails/password reset emails being flagged as spam, even on 3 different mail relay services, but with some very confusing and contradicting scenarios. Could use some advice on where to go (more info inside).","I'm running a site built on Laravel. I already had a previous site set up on a different domain, and I was just using Gmail SMTP+app password for now because it was new and very low volume, and the welcome emails/password reset emails never had any issues delivering. I cloned the site for a new project, got a new domain, and again, Gmail SMTP had no issues. 

The moment I switched to Postmark, immediately the same emails were flagged as spam, despite me verifying with their support that my validation stuff (spf, dmarc, etc) were all set up properly. If the content of my emails was the problem, you'd think I would have had this problem before (I'm using the default Laravel email text as well, so I know it's not weird wording that would be causing it). I tried this with 3 other services (Resend, Sendgrid, and Mailgun) and I had the same spam issues with all of them. 

On all the flagged email I've received from all my tests, 100% of them have shown spf, dkim, and dmarc all as PASSED by gmail. https://i.imgur.com/eosKR30.jpeg

It gets more frustrating, because the aforementioned situation should lead me to believe that the content of the email isn't the problem, but whenever I send test emails via other methods (ones that send raw text with nothing else) these deliver successfully on all services. The other methods I'm referring to are:

> Mail::raw('Hello World!', function($msg) {$msg-to('testemailhere@gmail.com')-subject('Test Email'); });`

and 

> curl ""https://api.postmarkapp.com/email"" \  
  -X POST \  
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \  
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \  
  -H ""X-Postmark-Server-Token: xxxxxxxx"" \  
  -d '{  
        ""From"": ""sender@example.org"",  
        ""To"": ""receiver@example.org"",  
        ""Subject"": ""Hello from Postmark"",  
        ""HtmlBody"": ""<strong>Hello</strong> dear Postmark user."",  
        ""MessageStream"": ""outbound""  
      }'  

Obviously the second one is only used with Postmark, but it delivers successfully when sent this way.

I've checked my domain and the the email contents on various spam checkers and nothing shows up as blacklisted or flagged/spammy, which makes sense because the emails work fine with sent through Gmail SMTP, and the raw emails also send fine through the test methods I mentioned. So it just makes no sense because no test gives me consistent results that help me pinpoint the problem. My domain is obviously not blacklisted/flagged because certain emails deliver fine, and the contents of the email are also not spammy or problematic, because they also deliver sometimes.

Anyone have any advice on where to go from here?

March 21 (Reuters) - Pemex's Deer Park, Texas, facility reported an oil spill into the Houston ship channel on Thursday, the refiner said in a community alert, adding it had isolated the site and deployed booms to contain the leak.  
""The oil had reportedly overflowed from a sump at the Pemex refinery in Deer Park,"" the U.S. Coast Guard said in an emailed statement, adding the cleanup is complete.  
""Personnel at the refinery shut down the system, placed a boom to protect the area and applied absorbent materials to clean up the oil,"" the Coast Guard said.

There is a pricing fundamentals side and a pricing tactics side. 

  
Here are four checks on the pricing tactics side I recommend to get started.

  
1) Is the upgrade path reason clear? The best pricing pages have a clear reason that you move between package A to B. It becomes muddled when there are 10 different features you get on the next package but the average customer only wants/uses 2 of those. This actually creates a psychology of loss (I am paying for stuff I don’t need). DocuSign does a good job of clear upgrade path. If I need something like Payments (a business critical need vs. nice-to-have) I know I need to move from Standard to Pro.  


  
2) Is the usage or payment metric clear? The best pricing pages make it clear that you are paying by usage, or contacts, or users. But there aren't 6 different factors that determine pricing. Gorgias does a good job here (pay by ticket volume) and then they have add-ons for the other bits.

  
3) Are the bundles simple? The best pricing pages have just a handful of line-items at the top that simply paint a picture of why you should get this plan. Slack does a good job of this (clean, simple bundles).

  
4) Are the personas clear? The best pricing pages allow you to quickly self-identify which package is right for you based on your niche, company stage or some other type of core requirement. SocialBee’s pricing page does a great job here (clear layout of best for solopreneurs, best for agencies etc.)",False,0.0127599999999999,"The post is focused on optimizing a pricing page for SaaS, not looking for technical co-founders or development services."
