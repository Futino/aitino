The Art of High Level Sales,"So you've been looking at improving some sales skills or getting into sales as a career. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this obviously. While sales comes naturally to some, there is a collection of small details you can take from each to improve your game. Some are naturally great a building rapport, some just speak with confidence, or some just have that natural aura that people feel comfortable around them. Those secrets will be exactly what this series covers. Starting with understanding how high level sales is an art form that can be replicated.   
  
  
  
  
  
One of the saddest mistakes a large majority of business owners and sales managers make is not training their sales people. Not having the right tools to perform the job leads to mediocre performance and high turnover rate. Sales is stressful enough, then add figuring it all out on your own. Most sales reps just mimic what they saw before and hope that works. You need to educated yourself. You'll hear me say this a lot throughout this series.   
  
  
  
Everything Is Hard Until You Understand It.   
  
  
  
Jiujitsu is an extremely technical sport. The better your technique the better you perform. Black belts take about 10 years to get on average. Just a decade of repetition and improving your skill set. Michael Phelps swam 8 hours a day for years without missing a day. Just improving technique and skills.  Imagine if you put that kind of effort into improving your sales technique and skills.   
  
  
  
While sales is hard to feel comfortable in at first. This playbook will give you the foundation early on to start succeeding and near the end, if you are following everything, you should be exceeding all your other reps. I'm going to teach you rapport building like I learned when I was a Human Intelligence Collector in the army. For those of you that don't know, that's the guy that does interrogations and convinces people to spy on their friends for our interest.  
  
  
  
We will be going over how to approach, where to look, posture, your tone, active listening, building a network and so much more. Everything I've learned over the last 14 years of doing every type of sales and always coming out on top.   
  
  
  
That's it for now. Pt. 2 will be Understanding the Sales Process. I'm going to cover an ideal sales process and how approaching it as a step by step system will significantly reduce the stress and give you confidence to close more consistently.

If you are in sales or interested in getting into sales, feel free to send me any questions you might have. I have no problem helping give some advice. I don't charge you for anything unless we're doing real coaching. If you have any request for information to be added to the playbook, just let me know. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I want this to be a tool you can use over and over for your entire career. Thank for you time. See you on the next one.

1bj7m89,,,,,,,,1710918831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1bj7m89/is_it_really_possible_to_get_rich_from_nothing_or/,Is it really possible to get rich from nothing or should I stay REALISTIC??,"So, I’m a 20M. I’m in my second year of medical school in my country. I‘m the oldest and only boy in a family of 7. My family falls in the category of lower middle class with lots of financial constraints.   


My parents are getting old and tired from the low quality of food and life and the tons of efforts they exert to keep this family alive, and I’m really grateful for that.

My question is that can I really get rich if I educate myself and work for it??? Or is it just a pink dream??

I’m asking this question because medicine doesn’t pay the bills in my country. Doctors work in the hospitals for minimum wage. 140 usd a month for a family of 4 is impossible. Not to mention how badly they’re treated and how long they work. 

It’s just not worth it.

&#x200B;

I‘d rather be own boss and work on my own thing.   
I’ve started to learn copywriting and this opened up my eyes. I know that it’s going to super hard. 

I find that I have to study an insane amount of things. Even more than what I study in med school. 

Writing emails, sales pages, funnels, etc. Prospecting, and outreach. Sales, and marketing. Studying my market and my niche and knowing how to give a high quality service. 

It‘s way harder than medicine because it’s all on me. 

My goal is to gain enough experience as a freelancer in these things and then start turning it into a business like an agency for example, and get into the world of business from there.

I’m practically starting form nothing. All I have is my phone and tablet. 

Is this goal worth it?? Will business relieve my financial constraints and help me provide the best life possible for my family?? Or is it just a pink dream the online gurus sell to young men like me???

&#x200B;

If it’s the right thing to do, I’ll be more than thankful for any tips or advice.

The gist is you can add activities for members of a community or customers to complete to earn points towards a reward and compete in a leaderboard. For me keeping my community/customers engaged was always a challenge and we did gamification albeit manually and with a lot of headache. So we thought to ourselves maybe why not build the tools to do this? Any perspective on this area?

We decided on $5000 on pre-revenue and he paid me $2500 without any long and deep due diligence but then he disappeared for 15 days, and there was no contact, I tried to reach him numerous times during these 15 days but no response. Then he replied and asked me to work for him even during the acquisition.   


we decided on the cost and started work for him with one of my colleagues. I paid my colleague a good advance amount and did ask my client to pay me but he said he would pay soon because he didn't do any due diligence and pay me without any delay in the start. I trusted him and we started working. 

&#x200B;

The work was way way more than what was decided. And I didn't charge for most of the small gigs as a goodwill gesture. And then came a makeover of this product. So I again asked for the remaining $2500 which was the acquisition cost and then the remaining cost up till that date of work. Which was around $1200. So total pending up till now was $3700.   


Then he said he needed to show a demo to one of his clients. At that point, I got to know that he was upselling the product but it was not my concern. I needed the money which was due at the first place. Then he ghosted me again for 8 days and suddenly he paid the remaining $2500 of the original acquisition cost then the Christmas holidays came and he just disappeared again for 22 days. 

&#x200B;

And then when he approached me, his tone was different. We worked so much on the makeover that the designs kept on coming, nothing was decided, and there were no boundaries set to the project I was afraid to ask anything because I wanted to get paid, I was not working on anything else, its going to be my bread and butter for the past 2 months and next 2 months. One night there was a bug in the app and he threatened me that he would stop working with me if I didn't make things right within one night so I keep working all night.  


I was disturbed and nervous but then I decided to ask for my payments. He said that he already paid, I told him that was the acquisition cost and then he said okay, transfer the ownership to him and he will pay, I transferred the ownership of the GitHub repo and he ghosted me for 26 days. I kept asking about the progress etc but he didn't reply then one night the app was down and he came back to me. I told him to pay then I would work on it, he said just turn on the app and he would pay right away.   


And the same thing happened again, that SOB ghosted me again. Now he said there were some negligible bugs, and he knows that I can solve those but according to him he pays only when the app was bug free. I even told him to pay in installments but he said no, he will not pay anything. And then he texted to part ways because it is not working.   


But today I am launching that app again and decided never to sell it again and increase the MRR to 10K.

I believed these people got lots of visitors and definitely customers who pay. Stories I heard a long time ago made me think this was true.

**We launched on Product Hunt on 1st of September.**

The month before, we worked hard to get ready. We did hackathons to make our product better and prepared a lot.

We worked all day and night, got lots of votes, lots of visitors, and hoped a lot.

**And**  
**We won.**

We were mentioned in Product Hunt's newsletters,  
Got a lot of backlinks,  
And many people talked about us on social media.  
We spent thousands on AI,  
And hundreds of hours making improvements we thought were important

...

But, as time went by, no visitors turned into customers. Even worse, we couldn't get any feedback from users. At the same time The Product Hunt community is overkind, so we didn't get real feedback there as well We didn't know what to do next.

**Our hope from winning on Product Hunt wasn't real.**  
In fact we didn't get any customers who pay from that launch.

We got into a classical trap: People like to make things simple. We want success fast and try to find shortcuts. But there's no easy way, and it's hard to deal with these feelings.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Every product takes a long time to succeed, and founders change things many times to find the right path.

We did too.  
Two months after launching, we added the payment wall.  
We started getting customers, having today over 100 paying customers  
And we're still making changes.  
We still are not happy with the progress.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell):

> In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.
 
After a few years of helping developers review code, I came up with 10 code smells and how to fix them while building my project [Axolo](https://axolo.co).

### 🧐 Refactoring Large or Complex Methods

Navigating through methods that sprawl across numerous lines or twist into complexity can be daunting. Simplification is key!

The fix? Employ a linter to enforce a maximum number of lines. Deconstruct these behemoths into smaller, more focused methods, each dedicated to a singular task.

### 🤔 Addressing Long Parameter Lists

A lot of parameters can muddle method signatures, making them prone to mistakes.

The fix? Consolidate related parameters into a single object. Adopt the ""parameter object"" pattern to streamline your functions, enhancing their readability and maintainability.

### 🙄 Minimizing Excessive Comments

An overload of comments often signals that the code isn't speaking for itself as clearly as it should.

The fix? Strive for code that explains itself through judicious naming and structure. Reduce reliance on comments, allowing the code's purpose and function to be immediately apparent.

### 🤦 Eliminating Duplicate Code

Repetitive code fragments are not just a nuisance; they complicate updates and can introduce inconsistencies.

The fix? Seek out and consolidate repetitive code segments into common functions. Adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle simplifies future maintenance and modifications.

### 😕 Harmonizing Inconsistent Naming Conventions

Naming chaos confounds understanding and introduces potential errors.

The fix? Commit to a unified naming convention. Names that are clear and consistent pave the way for code that's more approachable and decipherable.

### 😬 Enhancing Error Handling

Neglecting comprehensive error management can lead to erratic behavior and a codebase that's tough to sustain.

The fix? Embrace thorough error management. Logically log and manage exceptions to bolster the code's stability and dependability.

### 🤯 Simplifying Overused If/Else Constructs

An abundance of if/else branches can tangle code, making it challenging to read and adjust.

The fix? Lean on data structures or design patterns, such as polymorphism, to untangle complex logic, thereby enhancing the code's legibility and adaptability.

### 👎 Refining Inheritance Usage

Inappropriate reliance on inheritance can entangle code further, reducing its adaptability.

The fix? Verify that inheritance is used judiciously. Opt for composition over inheritance to achieve a code structure that's more flexible and straightforward to maintain. 

Be honest, which one do you usually see in your PR? If you think I'm missing something, let me know in the comments!",False,0.0128499999999999,The post is focused on software engineering best practices rather than seeking development services.

\- Now talking to as many customers as possible to learn from their feedback

\- I already spent way too much time on features that are rarely used. Extremely hard to find the balance between quality and overengineering.

\- Marketing is overrated, if the product is good people will come. 

\- Multiple currency support is super important, received a lot of feedback about this.

The idea being I will fully take over their business in the next year as the original owner retires. There is to be no cost/financial gain per se to the owner, as I will be taking over their liabilities and covering them (insurance wise) for the next 12 years. That is the deal. I will however have to cover costs during the handover such as purchase of equipment, legal costs and the transition month where they pull their money out of the business and I’ll be liable for the overheads during the month of transition where costs are coming in, but I won’t yet have had a full month of work to invoice yet (if that makes sense).

Prior to takeover I’ll be joining the business as an equity director to get upto speed with their projects and get to know their clients for a period of ~6 months. I’ll be bringing in work during this time (currently equal to 25% of their current income). My question is how do we decide the share allocation during this period?

They have proposed two solutions:

1. When I join I get a % of shares based on the work I’m bringing in. My concern with this is there is then no flex for if I bring in more work.

2. They charge my existing company as if I were a client for the work their staff do on my jobs. My concern with that is that takes all the profit out of my work. I’m effectively giving them that work for “free”.

I’m sure there are other options. I just feel like neither are the right fit yet, but I can’t think of what would work best. They are good people and we are all working in good faith towards this goal. Would really appreciate suggestions, thank you all.

The concept has already been proven to work as there are a few businesses doing well at this. I just think they could be done better, smoother and with cleaner UIs.

I recently stopped working for a SaaS startup who was doing something similar but more complex and for a more specific industry. So I'm taking what I learned from there and using it to build my own platform.

Using a no-code platform might not work based on my research (please prove me wrong). I've done some Javasctipt coding before and believe that using React to build this platform will be the best way to do it (The startup I left also used React to build theirs)

With my very limited coding experience, I plan on building this platform focusing on the core features first before releasing it.

Without giving too much away, the main feature is based around a kanban board style of management.

I don't know all the available resources that could be used to build something like this and would appreciate any advice or information please.

*Background:* I have an [older version of PhotoSwipe working on my site](https://photo.2re.net/) but I am learning Vue and the old version uses jQuery and jQuery conflicts with Vue.

All I want to do at this point is to use the code on the [Getting Started](https://photoswipe.com/getting-started/) page to work so I can figure it out from there.

It says you need the Core, Ligthbox, and the CSS.

I linked the css in the head like it says so I don't think that's the issue. My guess is that I'm putting the JavaScript in the wrong place but I'm not sure.

I've tried putting the JS code in a script tag before the HTML code, after it, making a separate JS file and linking to it in the head, linking to `photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js` and `photoswipe/photoswipe.esm.js` in the head, but nothing seems to work. I thought maybe the there was some kind of configuration on my computer not allowing me to execute JavaScript locally or something, so I uploaded my different versions to a web server and it still didn't work.

`import PhotoSwipeLightbox from '/photoswipe/photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js';`

After my last launch on Product Hunt didn't get featured, I spent quite a bit of time reflecting and asking myself why it didn't make the cut. It was a bit disheartening, to be honest. However, Product Hunt recently shed some light on this very topic, sharing key reasons why products might not get the spotlight we hope for.

Here's a quick list they shared that I'm keeping for next time:

* It's gotta be a SaaS product, not something like a PDF.
* Don't forget to add a maker comment for engagement.
* Check your links; broken ones are a big no.
* Schedule your launch ahead of time.
* No repeats; make sure your launch is fresh.
* Big updates only, no minor tweaks.
* Be clear in your tagline about what your product does.

I feel like I’m in an in-between state with the project where it’s not doing poorly, but it’s not scaling like crazy either.

People who use the product say it’s easy to use and does what it claims and almost all feedback is generally positive.

** Some things I’ve tried **
I’ve tried running ads on multiple platforms, but the customer acquisition cost is too high to sustain.

Improving search ranking with SEO, but my ranking for every term is abysmal. Google hates this site for some reason.

Affiliate marketing. I’ve been trying to land some affiliates while offering a 50/50 split and nothing up front. Was finally able to get an affiliate and I’m excited to see what this brings!


I guess what I’m really asking is that if you were me what would you do to try to grow from 1k users to 10k users?",False,0.00908,"The post is about scaling an existing B2C product, not seeking technical co-founder services."

Looking to formalize the verbal agreements that have been made, I'm looking for some templates that I can use to generate the various agreements. Looks like, at the least, we should have a partnership agreement and a shareholder agreement.

Searching for templates generates a bunch of links to sites that try to trick you into filling out a bunch of stuff, then withhold the actual document until you sign up/pay/whatever. I haven't found anything that's actually available without paying.

Does anyone have links to document templates that can be used to generate these agreements? Or am I on a fools errand to try to do this without hiring a lawyer?",False,0.0083,"The post is about legal agreements for a startup, not seeking technical partnership or development services."

Does anyone know if this even exists?

Is it even possible?

For some context, the purpose of this is because I manage an events directory that would greatly benefit from using event Schema for SEO indexation and the iFrame falls short so the ideal would be for some sort of conversion to take place from Airtable to HTML

The main ""kicker"" as I see it would be if data within airtable is linked to from other tables?
