2. **Don't get Banned! Warm your social media accounts**: Twitter banned my account after a few minutes and r/startups deleted my post because my karma was too low. I didn't spam or use any bots, but the fact is new accounts are ""suspicious"". It's worth warming your account.
3. **Post where you're already liked:** I got a lot more signups than I expected however they didn't come from large communities but from small discord groups. The engagement was much higher there because they already knew me. 
4. **Don't miss out on fresh eyes even if your idea isn't ready**: The feedback and suggestions I've gotten from early adopters has been invaluable. It doesn't matter where you are in development, START TALKING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. 
5. **Be ready to organize your early adopters:** I didn't have a waitlist page ready or a way to properly organize feedback, bug reports etc and tried to manage things through inboxes and DMs. Don't make my mistake. Whether you use a SaaS or something else, make sure you have a plan.
6. **The true test comes from actual use:** My startup manages a lot of dry, complex, business calculations for founders. It isn't exactly glamorous or in line with what usually trends on ProductHunt, so I had some doubts. None of that mattered after I saw real people try it out.

I ran a biz for a few years. I was planning on getting out when one day, someone walked in and offered me money for it.

I took the deal.

Now 5 months later, the business has slowed down.

The people who bought the place presented themselves with utmost confidence. I figured they knew more than I did about running a retail store.

But over time, I came to realize that they don't have any marketing skills. I feel like I'm barely past the amateur stage myself but these guys know *nothing*. They literally copy-paste my old social media posts.

They're also from a different country and brought mannerisms that can be quite off-putting. We did some B2B sales and they lost all the accounts within 2 months of taking over, because of stupid shit like hounding the clients for payment well before the due date.

I can tell the business is being mismanaged and bad decisions are being made. I've tried explaining it and making suggestions. But it just gets worse.

And yea, I feel guilty af.

That's the business I built and got paid for, and now this family is struggling.

Obviously this is pretty much beyond my control but it hurts, man. I have no leads to give them, nor do I have any more advice.

I have 40% and am the founder and I have 3 partners with 20% each. They came in right before opening (took me around 2 years with build out and licensing etc) to do day to day operations. The business has been running for 2 years now, they expressed interest in selling shares to move and invest in other things. I will go back to operating the day to day as I have more time now, than I did 2 years ago. 

Details:
- Business did around $700k in sales year 1
- year 2 we did just under $2m and we are tracking good for a $2.5m+ year 3
-the last 2 years we have not taken money from the company really (they pay themselves a small salary) and spent most of our money on growing the business
- lease has 7 years left + 3 year option at a very very good rate for our area. The lease alone is worth a bunch of money
- they want $250k each, so $750k total
- we talked about a full sell but I would rather keep it long term 
- I have talked to a few wealthy friends about them buying some of the shares and being silent. As it is already making money their distributions will basically be immediate
- if the investors do work out or not I want to look at all my options, like loans, this is where I need advice
-  the business has around $477k in assets 
- personal credit isn't great 650-700. I don't have much history (I'm 35), bought most of my stuff out right growing up. I have some credit cards a motorcycle loan and a car loan, all paid on time. 


I have never taken a loan this big. This business has almost no debt except a small payment for the liquor license (financed $140k 2 years ago. it is privately financed though an attorney that buys and flips them with his own financing). This business was purely bootstraped. I have another small bar and have had several others over the last decade so I'm pretty competent when it comes to creating and running successful food establishments. I do all the physical build out work myself barring any very technical stuff or what the city requires me to us a GC for. The only other loan I have had to take out was for my other spot and was SBA EIDL loan during Covid. 

My partner put me in touch with a loan broker or something and they mentioned having a few options (forgive me if anything is written wrong or dumb, I'm using their words). Something about a line of credit, which doesn't make sense to me. A large LOC that immediately gets fully spent, doesn't seem like a bank will like that. He asked me to use a site called IdentityIQ for a credit report so the bank does not do a hard pull, because I believe this broker works with mostly small firms. He was saying it is non secured, but I am fine with a secured loan against the assets. I'm not going anywhere. 

 If anyone can suggest other firms/companies or banks they have used that would be very helpful.

I read that and it kind of shocked me, does that even apply to me or is that for businesses that aren‚Äôt individualized or make over a certain amount?

So, I started web-programming about a year ago, having initially done some light code work for an open source video game (SS13). I got hired in a summer internship for a newspaper, but they kept me on once they figured out I'd learn any code stuff they threw at me. So that's weird case/background of how a non college trained (me) and not super experienced coder (me) got a web-development job.  


I work with some way more experienced coders, but I try not to bother them too much since we're covering a lot of ground with a few hands. I was hoping to get recommendations on where to best learn Django and Javascript, with Django being the particular framework we use at the paper (one of our executives actually helped found it...)  


I've gotten slightly comfortable with JS, having used Chart.js for some newspaper pages that need a special touch; but I'm still not really sure how to apply or use it. Django is also alien to me, since the coding I did back when I worked on open-source stuff was C based.  


I'd love any recommendations for resources on JS, Django or MySQL - as well as general advice for where to go next, and what to do. I really love my job and what I do, but it's a little hard to not feel underequipped compared to college-trained coders with 20 years on me.

But is there a consensus on which one makes the most sense?

The ways that I can think of are

- an .APNG file
- a .PNG sprite sheet, which the browser can animate through
- a .WEBP file

The animation is large (in terms of pixel dimensions, about 1920x1080), and only a few seconds long.

It would also be beneficial for file-serving reasons to be able to activate different portions of the animation (ie on mouseover) all from within the same file ‚Äî I assume sprite sheets provide a benefit here, unless WEBP or APNG have some sort of jump-to-frame ability? If not, multiple files would need to be loaded for the different animation parts.

I'm looking to create an automation and train an AI to be able to output text-based content for me. I want to train it specifically on the way to write the content, the thinking process behind the content itself, and really fine-tune a model to create this content. The content that I'm looking to create is social media content. I want to fine-tune the model based on my expertise with creating content and also copywriting, and being able to use emotion and storytelling in the content that's created. As far as the data, I can compile some of the best tweets and articles that I've written, also with full breakdowns and explanations of why I wrote them the way that they are, in addition to that, some training material on copywriting and how to think about copywriting and also storytelling through content. My hiccup is, I practically have no coding skills. I know that I could probably use make.com to create some type of automation. But I'm looking to actually fine-tune a model specifically on this task, and I don't know how to accomplish this. Even if this model just leverages the data and pulls from OpenAI's API to give me the outputs, that's totally fine, or if I even use one of the open-source models and fine-tune it to create the content for me also. But I'm looking for a way to actually have the model myself and not resort to 3rd parties to create the model, for example, and be able to play around with the tuning. I would either keep it locally or cloud-based, totally fine, and I could write up a quick interface.

Software engineer job, flat in Lyon (France), sold most of my belongings and went in Asia with a one-way ticket and my 50 backpack ~ 9kg inc. the MacBook.
Freedom drove me: the freedom to go wherever I want, whenever I want, doing whatever I want. Leaving France was motivated by the willing to unleash my entrepreneurial spirit. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was gonna do: freelancing, remote work, indie hacking, etc
The first few months of travel got me thinking a lot, and at a point I met this French entrepreneur (owning 3 digital agencies), during our discussion one point got me thinking for weeks, after I asked him what brought him to his current position: ‚ÄúI kept doing what I loved to do until people where willing to pay me for it‚Äù
That triggered this question within me: wtf can I do that I actually love to do? 
My life has so many different phases, from bartender in NYC, to carpenter in New-Zealand, to Engineer in the aluminum industry with international customers, to software eng in a French startup. I was like: fk, what‚Äôs the common element in this sh*t. What do I love to do. After weeks of background thinking it was cristal clear: I love to solve problems, and I love to build solutions for it. 

That‚Äôs where I started my indie hacker journey, one year ago. Then, long story short: 
- challenged myself for the first saas: created a WhatsApp bot integrating ai in couple of weeks (focusing on audio transcription as pain point)
- Then seeing the potential of AI, created another WhatsApp bot that would integrste everything (text, audio, image, etc) - which didn‚Äôt solve any problem, except leveraging WhatsApp to make AI more accessible
- Then created couple of free stuff, worldll‚Ä¢e (a bot posting daily pics representing the world based on the previous day‚Äôs news), and another stuff to interact with Karl Marx books
All my projects were drivent by technological curiosity, each of them allowed me to go deeper into using and applying AI (for instance, the ‚ÄúKarl Marx‚Äù was my way to use and understand langchain, , embedding, vector databases  / pinecone). 

First first project was making ~$150/ mo, from AI directories and couple of newsletters it‚Äôs been published in. 

The second WhatsApp bot was killed, it got spammed in Facebook group in North Africa and India and got me into issues with Meta, ending up with my business account being banned. 

Then I came a cross this AI influencer tweet lot of people have seen ‚Äúwe made $70k by selling 1$/min audio of an influencer on telegram‚Äù.
I was like: ‚Äúf*ck META and WhatsApp, I need to try Telegram. Let‚Äôs explore the text-to-speech and custom LLMs and build an AI girlfriend‚Äù. I focused on the erotic part of it to differentiate it a bit. First month it made $800. The lots of ups and downs. Most of my traffic is coming from AI directories, since i was one of the first ones to register it on it (did this saas over the week end at first, it was 6 month ago). 
It went to $2k, up to $4k at a point, now in between $2.2k and $3k. But I never did marketing, thinking that I don‚Äôt like this industry. I always hide myself in technological / features / experience improvement. Always avoiding the marketing. Why? There‚Äôs actually a lot of potential in this business. Health, wealth and relationship are 3 axis that will always make money. I had LOADS of times of introspections, hips of downs, some ups of course, here‚Äôs what I realised: 
- I‚Äôve been through the poorest phase of my life while being in Bali, had no savings left, needed to live on a ~15-30$ / day revenue (still had to pay some services and APIs with it)-> I had to deconstruct my occidental vision or financial security. Learn to live with almost nothing, with max 3-4 days of financial vision (the time Stripe takes to forward incomes to bank account). It totally changed my way of thinking. 
- I was missing a goal: I was seeking ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù. But what is it? How much do I need to generate? Not having a number on it was the best way to not achieve this goal. 
- I became dependent of a project I didn‚Äôt like: the ai girlfriend. It was (and is) keeping me alive, and somehow blocked myself from pushing it for ethical reasons, and afraid of being labelled as the ‚Äúai girlfriend‚Äù guy. but really: who gives a sh*t? Relationships & sex is taboo even though part of our daily life. Still, I went into the tech rabbit hole with always avoiding any marketing and trying to fix/improve the product, that even brought me to another thought: 
- Am I afraid of success? Am I afraid of making money? As weird as it sounds, I believe the last 6 months were actually a transition of the employee version of me, dreaming of entrepreneurship, to be an actual entrepreneur. Believing in myself. I‚Äôm always harsh on myself, which makes it hard to consider wins, even the smallest ones, but as well pushes me to keep going. In December I had 3 weeks of holiday in Vietnam with a friend, the first self-paid holiday. Not touching the laptop, and money was still flowing in. That‚Äôs a huge step. 

So now, here I am, got two products with market fit: $150 MRR, and $2.2k MRR. Did the strict minimum for it marketing-wise. 
Im in Bangkok since 3 weeks, heading back to Bali next week, and a clearer vision, after months of evolutions, learnings, ups and down. And my goal is simple: Break. This. Fkg. Glass. Ceiling. My. Mind. Created. 

How? 
1. Growing these two products
- Reduce churn = improve experience
- Increase conversion = rework LP and offers
- Increase traffic = MARKETING

2. Then going back to what I actually miss and love: Building new stuff. Fkg miss it. We should focus on what work yes, but as well focus on what drives us, and for me it‚Äôs the curiosity and the challenges a new product brings. But first, I need to hack and unlock marketing for me. 

This AI girlfriend stuff made me ashamed of Building in Public, so stopped to do it. Now I‚Äôm gonna be back and share my insights and learnings for growing my current products and creating new stuff. 

This post is a way for me to be accountable to ANNIHILATE this mind-made glass ceiling. 

I‚Äôll be sharing stuff again on twitter, [@maelus_](https://x.com/maelus_) - I‚Äôd love to connect with other indiehackers - could even Meetup if you‚Äôre in Bali / Bangkok / France, world is small when travelling & indiehacking.

They were saying how she sucks at what she does and how ugly her nails were. They were so incredibly rude while my mom was so nice and dense to what they were saying. They even said they were going to leave a bad review just because they can. 

I have a video that shows SOME of their behavior and actions, but I do not know if it is allowed to be posted in this sub.

I just don't want to worry about my mom and her workers being harassed by other customers such as her in the future. I know everyone gets bad customers, and I'm sure she knows that, but it's disheartening to see. 

Her business is lacking customers lately, and I did buy an AD to support her, and I do not want to see her be discouraged even more with these experiences.

So, how can I deal with bad customers that might come in the future? I really wanted to step up and say something, but I don't want to be unprofessional or maybe get hurt. ",False,0.00529

I ordered custom products off of Alibaba and my samples were great. However after placing an order, about 1/3 of one product has visible flaws and 1/4 of the other product has defects as well. Is this common when ordering things from Alibaba? They are only offering me 10% discount off of the damaged items only which is very frustrating.",False,0.0036399999999999
