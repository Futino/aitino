I see so many NFL, NBA, MLB, and other sports teams’ accounts on Instagram, with more than 100K followers. They post regularly on platforms like 20-30 times a day with a lot of views on each post. With that kind of following, I bet it should be easy to make money, but I never understood how.

I follow 2 primarily, that never ever make promotion of any sorts. They don’t do affiliate marketing on their platform either. I don’t see them doing merch or whatever. They are just posting regularly. I can’t believe they make that kind of efforts without even getting something out of it.

Anyone has an answer?

I’ll begin: As an entry-level content marketer, I use ChatGPT to kickstart my creative process and provide an outline/flow on the topics I’m writing. While the first draft often isn’t perfect, the custom instructions I’ve provided do help with a decent draft for me to start on. 

On the side, I’ve also built a few GPTs where I’ve coded brand guidelines and knowledge bases to improve the quality of my work.

What about you? I’m genuinely interested to hear how other fellow marketers are using these AI tools or GPTs so we can learn from one another :)

Alternatively if you feel AI-enabled output isn’t as good as human-created content, I’d love to hear your perspective too!",False
1bik83u,,,,,,1710854794.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bik83u/do_i_suck_at_programming_or_is_programmingmy/,Do I suck at programming or is programming/my project just really hard?,"I'm currently building a SaaS for a client (I'm a freelancer), and I'm super anxious that I won't finish the project. Not in terms of delivering on time (that's not going to happen, I've already accepted that) but in terms of my skill set. I'm being paid in monthly installments so I can focus solely on this project. Not finishing it would mean I'd need to pay everything back to the client.

I've been a web developer for 6 years, focusing on Frontend for 5 years, and I've considered myself a Fullstack Developer for 1 year. What I'm building now uses Nuxt 3 + Facebook API + Stripe + Supabase, and it's just very big – maybe too big for me. But, you know what they say, ""fake it till you make it."" I'm programming every day, learning, watching tutorials, making progress, and I see myself getting better every day. However, there are days when I think, ""how on earth am I supposed to do this alone?"" and it just stresses me out.

I've already hired a couple of freelancers to help me here and there with Supabase and the Facebook API. However, I have to be mindful of the budget, so I need to do most of it on my own.

Today, I experienced major frustration, which made me feel really bad about myself. I wanted to quickly implement a Google Autocomplete input in my existing form to ensure that users enter valid addresses. First, I had issues changing the database structure, then the Vue Google Maps library had an issue so I had to switch it, setting an initial value didn't work, and then I had issues implementing a custom validation rule into the form library I'm using. Now, I'm trying to figure out how I can trigger the input with the initial values, which is just a formatted address string so I can retrieve the latitude and longitude values.

Time spent on this task: 5 hours. I wanted to finish this task today and failed. Some of you probably would have finished this task in less than 1 hour. Now, I'm seriously wondering if I'm the worst programmer on the planet or if this is a struggle every programmer faces.

I'm really anxious about failing because it would be problematic financially. When I took on this project, I thought I could do anything if I just tried very hard. Now, with the Google Autocomplete input issue I faced today, I'm not so sure anymore...

Sorry for whining, just a small breakdown. If you've read this far, thank you very much.

**Edit:** I think I've found an answer to my question. After posting this 2 hours ago, I went for a walk and then got back to my laptop. Breaking down the issues I'm facing on a piece of paper really helped! I managed to solve the autocomplete issue within a couple of minutes and then moved on to the next task, which involved displaying leads from Facebook, making them searchable/filterable, and some CRUD operations. I  estimated 15-20 hours for these tasks, but after breaking them down and focusing, I got everything done in less than 2 hours! This meant I made up for the time I lost over the autocomplete. The reason for the quick progress was that I had already written reusable components. 

So I came to the following conclusions:

1. Yes, this project is hard.
2. Yes, I have a lot to learn.
3. I do not suck at programming.
4. Being realistic about my skills is why I have a Facebook API expert and a backend expert by my side, just a Slack message away.
5. I can finish this project, and I'm confident it will be a success :) 

Thanks for all the kind words from you guys. I'm breaking the tasks down as you guys suggested.

I'm currently torn about what country to register my company in.

&#x200B;

* Estonia via the e-residency program
   * Great choice, but recently raised their corporate taxes as the Estonian government looks to raise defence spending due to the understandable threat from Russia. Also... VAT is... high.
   * Has a fairly established program with some great A-Z service providers, but e-residency does not give you any rights to physical residency, which can make opening an account at a traditional bank account (like LHV) or getting Stripe integration done... haphazard.
   * Relatively cheap and straightforward to setup.

&#x200B;

* UAE via a freezone LLC
   * Great choice, offering some of the lowest corporate taxes (9%) and my country of citizenship also has a double tax treaty with the UAE, making it a very attractive choice.
   * Offer actual physical residency rights (renewable 2-year visa) and 100% ownership, allowing you to open a bank account and making getting Stripe processing much less less haphazard.
   * Most expensive option and takes the longest time (around 2-4 weeks), but will most likely recoup all costs due to the lower tax brackets compared to the other two options.
   * Need to travel to the UAE to open bank account and get residency card.
   * So many freezones to choose from, you get decision fatigue from that alone.
   * Not sure if setting up in the UAE is a good choice - reputationally, speaking?

&#x200B;

* United States via a non-resident LLC
   * Most of my clients are based in the US, but corporation taxes are higher and might get higher in the forseeable future (this is my personal judgement). Most legitimate option, however.
   * Will likely face the same issues with opening a bank account and Stripe integration that I would face with Estonia (unless I decide to get a residency permit in the United States and travel).
   * Pretty straightforward with a few (rather good) established service providers on the market.

&#x200B;

I've kind of outlined the different advantages/disadvantages of each option, but do let me know if there is something that I'm missing or not seeing. As I said previously, all and any insights are appreciated. My current annual turnover is around 50,000 USD/year with a margin of 50-60%.

I'm  looking to at least double that by next year and have two employees that will be based in my home country, which isn't really an option considering the unfriendly business environment, tumultuous fiscal state, and the fact that I have zero clients in my country and don't plan on getting any.",False

I have been playing with the idea of starting my own business for over two years, and i feel finally confident with the business plan to even consider putting it into reality. However, I am very afraid that it would be a step in the wrong direction and I would like to get feedback from more experienced people. So the thing is, i am 27,no kids no mortgage, i have a master degree in finance, worked during my studies as an accountant then as a business analyst for 3years in SME and after studies worked for 1year as a business analyst for a SME and now since 9months as a financial analyst at big corporation. I am not delusional and I am not looking for any get rich quick solution, I like finance, I am interested in making a business to see how it would be to make the decisions, take care of your full scope finance, build your brand and such aspects. I have considered a lot of ideas before but none of them passed my market research stage. I have landed on an idea about half year ago. I have scouted the suppliers and assesed the costs. This is product regarding to children so demand will always be there. I have mapped competitors who are selling identical products and similar products, from small to big players and assesed in which products i can compete against the big ones and plenty of stuff. Basically, there are a lot of small eshops selling these products (identically products from the same suppliers i was considering)at a ridiculous markup, my plan was to slowly build the business and the brand, and sell the products at a more human markup(still financially very attractive). I have recently gotten interested in graphic design and would eventually wanna move into product design and take the business eventually in this direction, to make my own products. The products im interested in would be stuff that are universally sized(playing mats, bed accessories…) not clothes so i do not get a lot of returns due to wrong sizing etc. I feel like this segment of market is interesting because ive been mapping the market(various mummy forums and fb groups, scanning instagram and asking people around) and a lot of people are travelling abroad to buy these identical items in neighboring countries because the shops within the country just have an insane markup. I would not be making inventory so no big investment, basically order on demand. So not a huge financial risk initially. I would keep my usual job of course, the job does not have a big workload and i have a lot of downtime(which is why i started to want to change stuff more lately) therefore, my question is, do you think, this would be a viable idea that could be succesful?

I think this will be a huge breakthrough for beginning developers in learning how to structure their code as professionals would - taking into account maintainability and scalability.

In [Part 1](https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA), I recreate a design from [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io/). When implementing the JS, I rely on the DOM nodes themselves as the state of the application. This is the most common sense approach for a newbie. The downside is that for every feature you want to implement, you have to react to a user action, take stock of the DOM elements on the screen, then update the right ones. This will likely require messy, nit-picky logic that gets difficult to maintain as the project grows.

In [Part 2](https://youtu.be/ieZM1SP9bjk), I restructure the JS to represent the state of the application as stored JS data. The process becomes: the user does something, I update the state data, and then I render out the UI according to the data. This makes the rendering logic more modular - if things aren’t rendering properly, I can isolate the rendering logic more easily. Also, the rendering logic will be largely the same for new features, so making new features becomes faster as the project complexity increases.

In [Part 3](https://youtu.be/mCxKs4oxdfA), I note that neither approach thus far has led us to a fully functional frontend app. We have hardcoded the user’s data, and upon refreshing the browser window, we are back to where we started. The user’s progress is not recorded. We fix this by using localStorage as our place to store the user’s updates, allowing us to bring the user right back to where they were if the screen is refreshed. I end by noting that by this point, you know all you need to deploy a legitimate and potentially successful application, mentioning the game “[2048](https://2048game.com/)” as an example.

In [Part 4](https://youtu.be/Muche31dDy8), I take you on a massive refactoring journey and paradigm shift to make your code as clean, maintainable, and scalable as possible. I start simply with the latest JS syntaxes and tricks, then I go deeper into how to structure your project to be less buggy and more maintainable/scalable as it grows - by implementing naming conventions, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), breaking the project into modular folders and files, and using Webpack to bundle and minify the files for optimization.

By the end of this journey you will be a significantly better developer who understands more professional levels of thinking, which will help with your future projects and communication in interviews, and separate you from other beginners.

Here’s the link to the beginning of the series - [https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA](https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA)

I hope you like it! I know it’s long, but it’s worth it!

What happens now?,"After signing a term sheet with an early-stage institutional investor and spending significant time negotiating (which cost legal fees on both sides), my cofounder suddenly decided to walk away from the deal and company for reasons that I won't get into here. We don't have other funding sources readily available in the pipeline, and I'm not particularly interested in continuing to work on the business after this.

  
This leaves the business with no cash to pay the legal fees. I tried to explain the situation to our lawyers, and they said that we need to pay and are threatening legal action against us.   
I was already out of ""personal runway"" when we signed the term sheet, so I have no way to pay from personal funds. The bills are not particularly large for a business, but significant enough to cause a financial strain even if I had a salary. Even if I had the money, I wouldn't be willing to (further) ruin my finances for somebody else's selfish decision. 

  
Someone I know is insisting that I'm overthinking this and we cannot be held personally liable. From what I've read this isn't true, unless we file for bankruptcy, and bankruptcy is a fairly expensive legal battle that is unlikely to make these bills go away, at least not completely. 

  
I'm trying to figure out what happens next and what we may be held personally responsible for. Are the lawyers just posturing? Am I wrong about bankruptcy and that's the path we should take? 

  
From what I've seen thus far it seems like it will probably be the best to just try to negotiate down the bills/get a payment plan and just cover as much as we can from personal funds. But in this case, what can I do if my cofounder refuses to pay or just ""ghosts""? For more background, we are incorporated as a Delaware C Corp, and I am CEO.

I'm an engineer myself and can build products if I know what problem to solve. But I think I need to revisit the problem since my initial hypothesis was wrong and I want to do some consulting to get closer to the original problem again. In other words, I need to go back to the drawing board, but I no longer have extra work to give to the ML engineer and, while the sales person is optimistic, he seems to spinning his wheels and hasn't made a single sale in 6 months.

I have 16 months of runway left with the current staff but there will be a 3-4 month period where I will have limited work for them.

## How Optimist Works

First, an overview/recap of the Optimist business model:

* We operate as a “collective” of full time/professional freelancers
* Everyone aside from me is a contractor
* Entirely remote/distributed team
* ~~Each freelancer earns $65-85/hour~~  (This year, we moved primarily to flat fees)
* Clients pay us a flat monthly fee for full-service content marketing (research, strategy, writing, editing, design/photography, reporting and analytics, targeted linkbuilding, and more)
* Packages range in price from \~$10-20k/mo

## The Financials

In 2023, we posted $849,747 (and 41 cents) in revenue.

This brings our lifetime revenue to $6,815,503.

It was our lowest revenue year since 2018 (just our 2nd year in operation).

[Here’s our monthly revenue from January 2017 to February of 2024](https://i.imgur.com/620nxbm.png). (\*Updated this)

Worse yet: It took us a full quarter to post any kind of profit. We ended up with a net profit of just 7% on the year.

Not exactly a “healthy” business.

Needless to say, 2023 was a challenging year all around.

Here’s what I learned.

—

Well, fuck.

That hurt.

When I left off last year, I explained how [we took a nose-dive at the end of 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/112zpfh/started_a_content_marketing_agency_6_years_ago_0/).

We lost about 50% of our revenue over the course of just a few months.

Of course, this correlated with the rise of AI, the decline in venture capital, and the generally iffy-ness in our economy that started off 2023.

It was not a fun period.

And, in fact, most of 2023 was a claw-scrape-and-grind kind of year.

***It took us over a year to bring revenue back up to our December 2022 levels.***

And all of those down months also exposed a glaring bug in the software.

The entire premise of Optimist was that we would have low overhead that would allow us to scale up and down without much risk. Since the vast majority of our expenses (contractors) are variable costs, we should be able to fly a bit closer to the sun—operating on thinner margins to pay for more premium talent.

…right?

Instead, the big dip in revenue revealed the bottom of the lakebed.

We immediately dropped into the negative.

For nearly half of 2023, we failed to post a profit—sometimes losing $10,000+ per month just to keep operating.

Of course, this is a bit of irony considering that my last update was all about how we were making strategic decisions to try to protect our margins and shed some of our least-profitable clients.

It all came home to roost.

We needed a new operating system.

## Profit First

I don’t consider myself to be an ultra-capitalist.

In fact, I’d say that I lie somewhere on the other end of the spectrum. After all, I started this company with a somewhat-utopian idea of structuring it as a “collective” and the basic premise that things could—and would—work out for everyone if we just focused on nurturing our team.

As a collective, profit was basically an afterthought.

As long as we could pay the bills each month, anything left over was just a bonus.

Emphasis: **As long as we could pay the bills each month.**

While we’ve had our fair share of ups and downs over the years, last year really exposed some of the vulnerabilities in our business model.

As I mentioned above, in 2023 we had months with 5-figure deficits. We failed to turn a profit—any profit—for nearly half of the year.

And when you haven’t prioritized keeping cash on hand to operate the business, things can get scary pretty quickly.

***You can’t run at a loss for very long when there’s no money in the bank.***

Of course, I was willing to personally invest in keeping the business going. I believe in it.

And, luckily, I’ve lived pretty frugally and could afford to float expenses for a bit if it came down to it.

But I’ve heard so many horror stories of founders totally abandoning logic and dumping $50k, $100k, or $1 million of their personal money into a business that ultimately failed.

***I did NOT want to write that update this year.***

So I decided that we had to rip off the band-aid and make deeper changes to the business in order to protect it over the long term.

I started reading articles and books that focused on issues like this to get some ideas about how we might pivot things.

One really stuck out to me: **Profit First by Mike Michalowicz**.

I won’t totally plagiarize the whole thing, but the basic premise is essentially this:

* Rather than standard accounting practice of subtracting costs from revenue to calculate profit, you should work the formula in reverse
* Start by setting a target net profit and then work backward to determine what you can afford to spend on all of the other areas of the business
* Allocate specific percentages to each bucket (sort of like an envelope budgeting method): Profit, taxes, operating expenses, payroll, etc
* Then immediately allocate all incoming revenue into these buckets using separate bank accounts rather than simply earmarking them in a spreadsheet

Of course, you can’t just magically achieve your desired profit margin by simply pulling it out first.

Instead, you have to set the goal and then **calculate your actual percentages** for each of those categories. Then, you can see which categories need to go up or down. Finally, you can conduct a deeper analysis for how you will adjust these percentages to align with your current goals.

For instance, say you have these goals:

* Profit: 20%
* Salary: 40%
* Taxes: 15%
* Operations: 25%

But your actuals for the last 12 months are:

* Profit: 10%
* Salary: 40%
* Taxes: 15%
* Operations: 35%

Now you know that you need to focus on a way to reduce your operations costs by 10% in order to raise your profit allocation.

It was extremely helpful to me to lay things out this way and to see where and how we were allocating our money. Plus, after conducting this analysis, it was immediately clear how we needed to adjust.

**We were spending a whopping 77% of revenue on operating expenses.**

Of course, I expected that our operating costs would be high because of the amount we spend on contractors. That’s how the whole business works.

But with 77% of revenue coming right off the top, there was barely anything left over to cover my salary, payroll taxes, software, and all of the other stuff we need—let alone posting a profit!

Looking at our financials made it clear there was a problem. But doing this analysis helped us understand what levers we needed to pull.

So I did some math and set some targets.

My goal was to reduce our operating costs by approximately 17% (over the next year or two; it’s not an instant process) in order to create breathing room in the rest of the budget and allow us to post a consistent profit.

Obviously, the biggest portion of these costs were the contractors (essentially cost of goods sold in our business model). So how could I help reduce these costs without giving everyone on our team a massive haircut?

To figure out where the money was going, we needed to dig deeper into our expenses and figure out which expenses were consistently coming in above target.

That’s where I hit the first snag.

## Aligning Incentives

Since the very beginning of Optimist, we’ve paid contractors hourly.

In fact, as an “employer brand”, we’ve been known for paying pretty well (up to $85/hour; decent for subtracting but, admittedly, not absolute top-tier rates).

Paying hourly is helpful for a number of reasons:

* Flexibility — We can assign ad hoc work however and whenever needed. We don’t need to stop and scope every project or deliverable before asking someone to do it
* Simplicity — People intuitively calculate their earnings on a per-hour basis. So other forms of payment (flat fee, per word, etc) generally get mentally translated into an effective hourly rate

So how do you build a business model based on a variable hourly rate?

Essentially, we operated on the law of averages.

Let’s assume we budget 8 hours of writing time per article. Some articles take 5 hours to write. Others take 10. They average out to 7.5 hours—we hit our target.

The problem?

Everything was taking longer.

We were consistently overshooting our estimates (our budget) on writing and design work. This meant our costs were going up unchecked.

But, even worse, from a budgeting perspective: The costs were very unpredictable.

Our law of averages strategy worked in some cases. But other times, every article ended up taking 10 hours—and we got completely hosed.

And, of course, there’s the matter of incentives. Hourly contractors have an incentive to spend more time on each project because it earns them more money. Usually, this is just because they want to spend extra time doing a great job. But their extra effort wasn’t in the budget—and it killed our margins. (Just a quick note here to acknowledge another point: It’s not implausible that some people would take advantage of this situation and pad their hours. For the record, I have no evidence that any of our contractors intentionally inflated their time to make more money.)

Once the work was already done, it was pretty difficult to try to claw that time (and money) back.

There was no mechanism to control these hourly costs. This also meant there was no way to make the adjustments we needed to make in order to dial in our financials.

Remember our goal to reduce operating costs by 17%?

This should be a simple matter of finding areas to cut back and tinkering with the numbers.

But if *every input* is a variable cost, then where do you even begin?

We would either need a whole new complex system for estimating and controlling costs for each individual deliverable or we’d need to impose some kind of cap on the hours spent. Capping hours seems like a plausible solution. But it introduces all kinds of new variables for different lengths and complexity of deliverables, handling unforeseen scope, etc.

So we made a different decision: **Flat fees.**

Rather than paying hourly for work completed, we would set a flat rate for every role within the organization. This would be a one-time payment for each “task”.

This is something we discussed periodically throughout the life of Optimist. We’ve gone back and forth on whether the hourly model was truly best for us as a business and for freelancers.

(Many freelancers loathe hourly rates.)

We kept falling back to hourly rates, mostly because of the convenience and flexibility they offered. But with so much riding on this decision, it was clear that we had to just make the leap and roll out a system where our costs could be fixed and predictable.

This would give us the data we need to model the business and then make adjustments in order achieve profitability.

So we sat down and mapped out all of the clients and roles across the team. We sliced everything down into the smallest possible increment—from writing and editing to setting up Asana tasks. Then we mapped out what we could afford to pay for every role while maintaining a reasonable profit margin for each client.

This is still an ongoing process.

But, in 2023, we rolled out flat fees for the majority of our existing clients and set flat fees for future clients.

As with anything, there were tradeoffs with this decision. For starters, many of our long-time contractors were not thrilled. Rightfully so—it effectively capped their potential income from any one article or client. They also mentioned that it disincentivized them to spend extra time polishing or improving their work. You could view that as both a benefit and drawback.

We had to evaluate all parts of the equation.

Benefits of flat fees:

* **Aligned incentives** — Contractors can earn a higher effective hourly rate by finding ways to be more efficient and delivering publish-ready work
* **Predictable** — Clear expenses for any given project/client each month
* **Equitable** — Generally speaking, the pay to folks on the team is roughly equal and equitable. (Some clients currently have lower flat rates than others)
* **Better controls** — Even if it’s difficult, we have immediate levers to adjust costs moving forward

Downsides of flat fees:

* **Fixed expenses** — The costs are more rigid. We can’t “make up” for an extra expense by spending less time on another project or task
* **One-way street** — Setting flat fees for work is tricky. And it’s mostly a one-way street. It would be difficult and painful to try to reset these rates if we pay too much. So it’s important that we really scrutinize the amounts upfront
* **Inflexible** — It’s now much more difficult to ask contractors to take on ad hoc work or odd-shaped projects that don’t fit into our standard workflow

Stepping back, though, ***I*** think it’s clear that flat fees were the right move for us.

## Risk vs Reward

I think hourly rates make more sense in a more hierarchical business. When you pay hourly rates against a fixed budget, you are, essentially, ***betting*** that you can design a workflow and execute the work faster than the time you have before you hit breakeven on a project.

As a business, you’re taking a risk.

Any time you take a risk as a business, you want a mechanism to control that risk.

In practice, you would mitigate that risk through management and tighter controls.

In our case, we are a flat organization. Everyone is a contractor. There are no managers. We don’t control how the work is done or how much time it takes. So, for us, to take the financial risk of an hourly model puts us in an impossible situation.

It never really made sense for us to use this model. But it seemed like the easiest solution. And it only took almost 10 years to realize that we had this giant liability hanging over us with almost no way to protect ourselves from the downside.

Another lesson that seems intuitive—if not obvious—in hindsight.

Shifting to flat fees also exposed more opportunity for us to continue to evolve the business.

## Productize All the Way Down

Last year, I wrote a lot about productizing our service business.

(Hint: [I’m a big fan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/snl8c1/productizing_a_bespoke_service_0_to_4539659_2022/))

We made huge strides in productizing a lot of what we do over the last few years. But we still held on to some of the things that we didn’t want to shift.

In fact, just last year, we touted rolling out hourly engagements.

I think that was a mistake.

Having some clients pay a flat fee and others pay hourly meant juggling between the two work modes, keeping track of which clients were billed under which methods, and stringing together invoices that would normally be a flat fee.

It was messy.

Especially once we shifted to flat fees internally, it was clear that this no longer made sense.

If we were going to be a productized service business, we had to productize all the way down. Every client, every engagement, every deliverable should fit into a productized workflow and process.

It’s still a work in progress.

But my goal for this year is to fully scope, productize, and assign a flat fee to all of our work. There are a few remaining outliers, but this should be do-able within the next 6-9 months.

The other big benefit here is that we can productize and sell individual services.

We can better customize packages to fit within our client’s need.

Want just strategy and content briefs but have an in-house team that will handle content creation?

No problem, that’ll be $X per month.

Just looking for a one-off strategy project?

That’ll be $Y.

Looking for whole, end-to-end retainer with 6 deliverables per month?

That’s $Z.

As the industry continues to shift, we need more flexibility to adapt our services to fit within the market. Historically, we haven’t done a great job of this. We’ve basically turned down any client who didn’t want the full menu. Now, we’re seeing more clients who want parts of what we offer but don’t want the whole thing. We need to adapt to that reality.

Theoretically, the idea of productizing your service while also offering a broader range may seem counterintuitive.

How can you standardize the menu if it just keeps expanding?

I think there are two keys here. One is to break down all of our work into discrete components. From keyword research to briefing, writing, editing, etc—every role should be a modular part of the service that can be added, subtracted, or bought off the shelf.

The other key is to learn to evolve—faster.

## Evolving Faster

Over the last year, there have been near-constant changes happening in the SEO and content marketing industry.

It seems like every week was a new algorithm update, a new AI tool that will “kill search engines,” or a new workflow that changes the way you write and communicate.

And it exposed one more flaw:

We are slow.

We have been slow to adapt and evolve as the market has shifted. This is partially because of our flat hierarchy and not having a full-time team.

There’s no strategy or innovation team that’s constantly working on new, better ways to do things. We can’t quickly pull together a task force to brainstorm and implement a new plan. Most of our work is day in and day out—repeating the same processes. Plus rolling out updated workflows to a decentralized team of contractors is challenging.

So how do we keep up?

We need:

* Mechanisms to capture and respond to these changes
* Dedicated time and space to just think about the things we are doing and how we are doing them — and then changing them
* Processes for making those changes and integrating them—in real time—without blowing up the ongoing work that’s constantly in motion

We have a wonderful ops person (Katy) who handles most of the client and team comms + day-to-day operations. But because she’s so heads-down on execution stuff, there isn’t much space for big-picture thinking and planning.

I want to change that.

I want more of Katy’s time focused on working with me to plan, architect, and deploy changes to our business more quickly. We need faster cycles and established timelines so “meta work” like updating our processes doesn't constantly float in the ether or take a backseat to pressing client projects.

But before we can do that, we need a system.

## Workflows for Workflows

For the first few years of running Optimist, we flew by the seat of our pants.

Everything was ad hoc—”bespoke”—and felt custom.

**It was also noisy, unpredictable, and chaotic.**

No more.

I am a 100% convert and true believer in the [power of workflows, process, documentation, and SOPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/sird1e/working_on_the_business_rather_than_in_the/). If it’s not documented, good luck getting it done consistently, on time, or within budget.

In fact, I’ve taken that stance beyond just delivering the day-to-day work.

I want a workflow for everything.

I want to understand the ebbs and flows of our business and have a defined cycle, system, and project for handling it all. From the big loops like yearly planning to the small loops like weekly check-ins.

I want predictability.

I want rhythm.

The work itself—sitting down to write an article or design a graphic—is rarely “routine”.

But everything else should be.

So, as a way to address the previous challenge (faster evolution), I want a clear workflow in place that dictates when and how we will make these changes.

Again, this shouldn’t be a surprise or ad hoc. It should be predictable.

Once per quarter, we set aside time to do the evaluation, planning, and scoping for changes in our processes and workflows.

Once per quarter, we implement all of the changes we plan to make to those workflows.

Once per quarter, we update all of our documentation and workflows to reflect those changes.

Once per quarter, we communicate those changes to the team.

It’s a system for updating our systems.

Am I control freak?

My therapist might say so.

But, my personal neurosis aside, I feel like I’ve learned a larger lesson after nearly 10 years:

***Everything has a cycle.***

No matter how special you think your business is or how unpredictable your work might feel, there is an underlying pattern to how things ebb and flow.

And if there isn’t, then that means you have the opportunity to *define* that cycle.

Many of us run our businesses by bouncing from thing to thing. Whatever needs to get done that day is where you focus. And you ping pong from one priority to the next, waiting for the next fire to break out and require your immediate attention.

My strategy is to put that fire in a box.

Rather than waiting for things to crop up and crash my day, week, or year, I want to be proactive about when and how I will fight those fires.

Being proactive means keeping all of the matches away from the kindling.

And the mechanism for that is to have a defined workflow for as much of the business as humanly possible.

If we’re assessing and updating workflows once per quarter, then (in theory), we shouldn’t have an emergency situation where the workflows are outdated or no longer fit within our systems. We’re focused on maintenance and evolution rather than day-to-day problem solving.

Admittedly, this is a bit of a privilege.

In the early days of building your business, it may be all you can do to just keep the wheels turning. But as your business grows and matures, investing in process and predictability has a 10X return on your time.

## Looking Forward: The Future of Content & SEO

As I closed out last year’s update, ChatGPT and generative AI were just entering the scene.

This tech seemed like a massive disruptor for our work.

Headlines everywhere declared that content marketing was going to be done by bots, SEO was dead, and marketing agencies were about to be wiped out.

So where are we now?

I don’t know.

It’s still a question mark.

Many of the most dire short-term predictions haven’t really panned out. And, if I zoom out on the conversation, it seems that the tone has shifted from, “AI can do anything and everything,” to, “AI is good at some stuff, sometimes.”

Even so, this is still a big threat.

Or an **opportunity**.

I don’t want Optimist to be another in a long string of businesses that thought they could just put their head down and ignore changes happening around them. I’m not going to assume that AI won’t affect us or that, “it’ll never replace humans!”

Again, I want to be proactive. I want to embrace AI as part of our workflows.

And I want to shift our business toward higher-value work.

This is one of the reasons we need to be able to evolve faster.

One of the things I want to focus on this year is prioritizing the parts of our service that are less susceptible to AI replacement:

* Strategy and research
* Content management and optimization
* Content consolidation
* Measurement, forecasting, and roadmapping

Right now, we do all of these things as part of a full-service package that generally includes creating new content. But if content creation becomes more easily commoditized, it seems obvious that the higher-order strategic work will hold more value over the long term.

We can’t run from it. We can’t hide from it. And we can’t let it kill us.

So the only real option is to embrace the change.

Help our team upskill, develop new systems, and launch new services that better align with the world of AI-assisted content marketing and SEO.

Like it or not, that world is here—and moving fast.

How sales works, when do marketing is most effective, how to use social media effectively to build an audience for promotion, I knew nothing of that sort.

 *As side projects I tried many different things during this period like*   
*1. I build a infrared blaster to control all the remote control appliances at home*   
*2. No prick blood glucose monitor*   
*3. chrome extension for job applicants*   
*4. SaaS platform for independent recruiters.*   
*All were hobbies and never released to general public.*

I started doing what every ""WannabePreneur"" does, mental masturbation. I started consuming lot of information about what is the latest trend, how you can earn quick money, the ways by which you can earn money etc. etc. etc.

Although I did learn a lot from this info but most of the things were just focused on one thing $$MONEY$$. I don't know if everyone on YT who claims to have made it big and now can share this same info  in $500, $1000, $25000 (damn) is running a scam, but I came to realize that you are only going to know the depth of the water either by going into it (learn by doing) or find someone who can tell you that (a mentor).

I am a Introvert guy, so reaching out to some stranger and asking to be my mentor was like you are ""asking me for my soul"". So I started searching for a fix for this situation. 

Now the next challenge was what to build. All the ideas that I thought of building a product for was already built by someone. So I got into this trap that as I am unable to come up with unique idea I am doomed. I'll never be successful entrepreneur. 

I got depressed that I am not able to generate unique ideas. One evening I was just scrolling through internet (in search of a brilliant idea) I came across multiple version of same product built by different people, and all were successful to some extent. Then suddenly I remembered quotes that I came across in many books, videos, posts  1. ""Ideas have no worth if not executed properly"" 2. ""The markets are so vast that you can build an exceptional product in an eshtablished, crowded market and still be successful"".

This was something that bought me out of my slumber and depression. I decided to build something that is interesting, future proof (AI, duh), and I have some experience on. I have more than a decade of experience in building solution in Customer Support segment. 

So I thought why not build something in Customer Support area and then the execution will take care of the rest. And even if this doesn't work out, I will learn a lot of things (apart from engineering) like sales, marketing, promotion. Maybe during this process I'll be able to uncover some gap in the market which needs a solution.

Based on this assumption I built a [Customer Support Copilot](https://www.cyanarrow.com) for businesses (slightly being selfish here ;) ). I will be honest that currently in no way this is a successful startup but it surely is a start of something for me.

Do you think I am on a right path? Why?

Do you think I am doing it wrong? Why?

Do share your thoughts.

I hope it'll some perspective to someone who is still on the fence, and is willing to take the plunge into this wonderful world of Entrepreneurship.",False

A bit of background: I run a small, product-based business that's just started making only few sales primarily online. However, with the upcoming celebration month, there's a plethora of fair and bazaar opportunities to showcase my brand that align with my customer base. Booth/table pricing ranges from $900 with smaller, less-known event organizers to $2,000 with prominent organizers promising a spot in a major mall (they've mentioned an average of 6k sales per vendor).My primary goals are to drive direct sales and boost brand awareness. I'm weighing the potential benefits against the significant financial investment; for context, $2,000 could also be allocated towards producing another batch of our products

Bill works within property management, and has a very deep insight into the services most commonly used by both small and large property companies. Bill approaches Ted, and says that every month there are a large amount of small jobs (such as waste disposal, PVC replacement, etc) that these companies don't even bat an eyelid at paying up to £5000 to be completed.

Bill knows many of the contractors who carry out these small jobs. Bill suggests to Ted that Ted should open a limited company, and that she should begin taking on work from the property companies for small jobs, utilising contractors to carry out the work, and skimming profit off the top.

For example, Bill suggests Ted's new company (Ted LTD) for small jobs to a property company that manages 200 homes. A house is to be revamped, and the property company wants the house completely emptied in a timely manner, and accept a quote from Ted LTD for £5000.

Ted LTD then hire contractors suggested by Bill to do the work for £2000, for this example he hires Gubbins LTD. The work is complete, and Ted LTD invoices the property company for £5000, and when this is paid he then pays the invoice from Gubbins LTD for £2000, keeping the difference of £3000 as profit. Is this legal?

In addition to this, if Bill wanted to split the profit and get a 50/50 kickback from the work, and call it a referral/finders fee, could Bill invoice Ted LTD from his own limited company (Bill LTD) for £1500? Would Ted LTD be able to write this off as a tax deductible expense, such as services rendered/marketing/advertising/etc.?

Or is this all hella shady and illegal?",False
1binifl,,,,,,1710863505.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1binifl/dont_miss_out_on_my_failure/,Don’t Miss Out On My Failure,"Hey, so I just want to share my experience starting a business ( in the Caribbean ) for the past 8 months and what Ive learned through mostly failing at it so far. 

Hopefully, this will help someone who’s thinking about doing the same thing. Originally, I started a web design business but eventually branched out to doing both web design and video editing.

My business hasn't seen much success, I haven't made a single sale to date on the web design side of things but I've learnt a couple things. Here's a couple things I've learnt:

1. At times you should listen less to what people say and more to what they do. We generally assume customers know what they want but  I believe some don’t. At the start I was conducting interviews and collecting data on the general interest of consumers towards hiring a web designer. Many said they needed a website but why hire a web designer when they were expensive compared to web builders?

So I marketed myself at an affordable price that was competitive against even website builders (I live outside of the US, so it was still profitable for me), many people were interested in buying because they had little time to figure out using a web builder themselves but still no one sealed the deal and remained without a website till this day. I believe that clearly this was showing that the problem wasn't the pricing or affordability but something else, maybe the business owners I contacted just did not see having a website as a priority. If you asked them they would say that a website is a need for a business but their actions would show otherwise.

Of course this is my experience in The Caribbean. I would think business owners in more developed countries generally see the importance of having a website versus using a Facebook page.

2. Pace yourself or break yourself. I would find I would overwork myself trying to get my business sales as quick as possible and try to do certain things at a pace that wasn't healthy. The worst thing is, I would overwork myself and then I would get no results, no sales, no traction. Being unemployed and broke, I would tend to feel useless not doing something but doing something doesn’t mean you’ll get to where you want to go any faster. It’s better to pace yourself. Taking a little break in between tasks will help you mentally. You can handle problems and issues better if you have occasional breathers. 

Those are the two main things I’ve learned. I also would appreciate it if anyone would give me some advice on the next step. I recently started video editing, something I used to do back in the day. I have gained customers but it's not substantial at the moment but I'm more optimistic about it than web design. 

My business website domain is about to expire, based on what I’ve said, should I renew it? or let it expire and just transition into just video editing and focus on that? I’m struggling to decide if I should waste more time on the web design side of things. Thanks for your time.

I’m really not trying to market myself, if anyone wants to see to give better feedback, this is my business website: >![here](https://www.everyonecanweb.com)!<

Keep in mind I’m in the Caribbean is doable for me.

They also post videos and have been able to monetise it with a few other things. 

They want a mobile app and a web app where they will post their content. They basically want me to build it but they don’t want to pay upfront. Instead they want to come to an arrangement where we sign a contract and I get a percentage of sales, but there is a cap on the upper limit. 

Revenue will be a combination of ads, subscriptions and online courses.

1. Admin app (manage recipes including calories, users, metadata, data analysis etc)

This is a real question and actual businessmen will have an educated response.

In my adult life, I have been through two Democrat presidents and one republican president.

I can absolutely tell you that during the Democrat presidencies, I have struggled financially on an extreme level, a level that affects my health.

Has anyone experienced this? What is your educated and experienced opinion on why this happens? Has your business struggled during one or the other like mine has? Have you had trouble finding work during one or the other?

For me, it has been completely totally impossible to live with Democrat presidents. I’m talking starving, everything is in collections, credit in the toilet, and then a republican gets elected and I pull straight back out of it and things are great.

I believe it is more than likely the herd and their lack of intelligence. They have this belief system that the world is ending because of the president so the worthlessness meter pegs out and stays in the red until their knight in shining armor president comes along.

I say it is due to the herd because we cannot do everything ourselves. If you want to mow yards or be a selfie star, you don’t need anyone else… if you’re trying to really do something it’s not that easy unless someone dies and leaves you money.

Over the past 2 years, I've delved deep into the world of UX/UI, from conducting user research and creating wireframes to refining user flows and polishing final designs. Currently, I am the product designer at a tech company, where I've had the chance to overhaul and fine-tune our product's user experience.

[https://www.jaywinebrenner.com/](https://www.jaywinebrenner.com/)

My worries: 

I'm starting to think the design may be too far outside the box and it could potentially be a turn off in that it doesn't showcase my ability to design / make a site with a more standardized real-world aesthetic.

I'm also starting to think it could be getting bloated? The ""Bored"" section may be too much? I put it there to showcase different technologies I've been playing with. But perhaps it's just too much.   


Also, I've worked at creative agencies making websites for 4 years and I'm torn about whether or not to put them on the ""Projects"" page. Because, well, I didn't make them exclusively by myself. Does anyone know if that is a no-no to put up projects you've worked on for a past company?   


Anyhow, thanks!",False

One day, I decided to leave my hometown and put out my resume, and that's when a restoration company contacted me. They were impressed with my experience and seemed to urgently need someone for the position. I accepted the job, only to realize that they didn't have a collections department like my previous workplaces. They were clueless about skip tracing and heavily relied on an expensive attorney, sometimes taking more than 50% of the collections. I managed to convince them to invest in a skip tracing tool, and they were astonished but also impressed by the results.

Once I had the skip tracing tool in place, I started collecting without even needing to pick up the phone; emails became my preferred method of contact. I even successfully convinced customers who were suing us to drop their cases and pay up. Despite my remarkable achievements, the owner didn't show much emotion or appreciation. During the interview, I had asked for a commission instead of focusing on hourly pay, and they agreed to consider it after 90 days if I proved myself.

Excited by the opportunity, I collected $150k in my first month. After the probation period, I approached the owner for commission, but he claimed the business wasn't doing well and needed to consult with other franchise owners. I gave him the week he requested, and when I followed up with a comprehensive report of my achievements, they declined to offer me commission or even a raise. They cited that no one in that position had earned more than my current salary.

Disheartened but determined, I continued working while observing the industry closely. I realized how hesitant people were to start their own businesses, especially when it came to collections due to fears of regulations. So, I took matters into my own hands and created my own collections agency. I drafted a business plan, established an LLC, built a website, developed a day-to-day business system, invested in equipment, branded my company, and launched it.

I discussed potential earning opportunities with the owner, but he wasn't interested. Instead, he told me I could keep my current job until I found something else and warned me not to harm his accounts. However, my intention was to resign and offer my services through my agency. Unfortunately, despite the impressive setup and efforts to market my services, I haven't had much success in gaining clients.

Now, I find myself without a job and unsure of my next steps. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",False

I'm moving out of state and underwriting wants a letter from a CPA saying that the move will not impact my business. I spoke with a CPA and they said they wouldn't sign off on that due to liability and how would they know that my income wouldn't be impacted....

  
I'm not sure what to do here - has any self-employed folks encountered this?

Where x is located is irrelevant to how the company is paid""**",False

I'm in need of some advice regarding a taxation issue with my mother's C-Corporation. As her Power of Attorney, I've been delving into her tax returns and discovered a concerning error.

Consequently, she's facing double taxation – paying both corporate tax and additional self-employment tax on the income reported via 1099.

1bip5ip,,,,,,1710867458.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1bip5ip/we_removed_our_free_tier_and_increased_conversion/,We removed our free tier and increased conversion 17% (& deal size 34%),"""Unless the product sells itself, it's a bad product.""

""If it needs humans to explain it, you need to work on the product.""

""Sales teams are just a sign of a bad product""

That's what the SaaS world indoctrinated us in the past few years (and it was the dominant narrative in our YC batch). Product-led growth (PLG) was the future... and me and my team believed it—so we built a generous free tier... 

...and attracted tiny companies (we're B2B) that rarely upgraded. So we axed it and did the thing users love to hate: 

**You can only trial our product after a demo with sales.**

This was one of the best decisions we've made—even though it flies into the face of product-led growth. Here are the two results: 

* Without much change in top-of-funnel leads, we grew deal sizes by 34%. Why? When you schedule a demo, you start to think who needs to be in that meeting, which lets you talk to more senior people.
* Conversion went up 17%. I think it's because the trial is limited, which creates urgency. Plus, if you have a human showing you how to get the most out of your product, your trial experience is better ergo you're more likely to buy.

Now, that's just our experience with a product that's a) multi-faceted and b) takes time to implement. That's why I talked to a few other founders (incl. some from YC) that are sales-led. 

Here's a few best of quotes:

*""Once we opened up the product for free, we stopped learning. It was like we were flying blind. We didn’t know what people were doing, what they were trying to do, and what issues they ran into”*

\-Bobby Pinero, Equals

At the early stages of any SaaS company, you get to PMF faster the more you understand users. And no survey popup can tell you as much as a few half-hour phone calls with potential users. 

*“We actually have a pretty strong opinion on this: early-stage companies should never be PLG. Maybe with some exceptions, but so much of what you're doing is about learning and you lose a lot of that if you don't talk to people, you don't hear what they want or watch them set up the product. We think that’s a mistake for early-stage, even for small deals.”*

\-Marty Kausas, Pylon (YC W23)

A takeaway for me here is that many founders think they should just be coding all the time instead of getting on a call for a user that might pay $10/mo. But if you're unwilling to do that, you won't get to the insight that leads to the $1000/mo deals.

*“Our product is just not a great fit for PLG. Airbase is a very complex product. You have to implement it, it has to be integrated into all of your workflows. You have to get all your vendors and employees onto our system. That’s not something you just do without help or planning.”*  
\-Darcie Lamond, Airbase

I really liked this take because it shows you need to derive your growth strategy from first principles. It needs to fit how your product works, not what you can brag about on Twitter.

  
*""We found product-led growth to be limiting, particularly in how it structured user access and feature availability. Our product had a broad range of features, but customers generally needed only a subset. Adopting a flexible pricing model based on individual needs helped us secure deals that a rigid PLG model would have hindered.""*

\-Sahil Hasan, Dots (YC S21)

I thought the implications of PLG on pricing are interesting because most PLG people preach that PLG will get you more users & customers—but didn't work for Dots as hey wanted to customize more. 

I hope this was useful if you're still working on your own growth strategy! If you want to read my full takeaways from our experiment of axing the free plan & the interviews, I've created a full writeup [here](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/maybe-you-dont-need-plg-after-all/).",False

The need arose from a company I spoke to who has an interesting use-case/requirement that I can build a solution for. After speaking with them and doing my own research, I believe there are others who would buy it as well. Its niche, but I wouldn't need too many customers to consider it a long term success.

I told myself if I can get them to agree to buy the solution and be my ""first customers"", I would build it out as a platform and look to sell it to others. They know I want to do this, are excited, happy to provide me with feedback on the platform, advise me, be a reference, and most importantly introduce me to others in the same industry who may have the same need.

They're a non-for-profit and cost is an issue. I will have some hard costs from 3rd party vendors I must use to meet the needs, and I was hoping to make a 50% margin on them to start.  

Looks like for what they want to pay vs what my hard costs are I can get a 30% margin. Thats also assuming I do all the work myself for now...Is that good enough?

My gut tells me ""If you think you can build it into a successful business, you should be willing to do it at a break even or even a loss to get the initial customer/reference/advisory/etc.."" Maybe I'm just not confident enough in the idea and want to fall back on the fact that its succesful even for them only?
