                                    I'm a business analyst with a fully specced out app and have been approaching Devs for the build for a web app/hybrid app mvp.

Initial estimates are around $25000. I'm having more sessions with other Devs to get comparable quotes.

I'm in a position where I could afford to do this but I was initially (potentially naievely) hoping for something around $10000...

Question is.. go forward with this as a 'why not' attempt to start this business or take a step back, more market/customer research/potentially find investment etc...

So.. hype me up or dissuade me ðŸ™ƒ
